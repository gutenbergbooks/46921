<h2><a href="#CONTENTS">PREFACE.</a></h2>
</div>

    <div>

<p class="noindent">Those to whom the Life of Pascal and the Story of Port Royal
are unknown, must be referred to works treating fully of the
subject, since it were impossible to deal with them adequately
within the limits of a preface. Sainte-Beuve's great work on
Port Royal, especially the second and third volumes, and "Port
Royal," by Charles Beard, B.A., London, 1863, may best be
consulted by any who require full, lucid, and singularly impartial
information.</p>

<p>But for such as, already acquainted with the time and the
man, need a recapitulation of the more important facts, or for
those who may find an outline map useful of the country they
are to study in detail, a few words are here given.</p>

<p>Blaise Pascal was born at Clermont-Ferrand in Auvergne,
on June 19, 1623. He sprung from a well-known legal family,
many members of which had held lucrative and responsible
positions. His father, Etienne Pascal, held the post of intendant,
or provincial administrator, in Normandy, where, and at
Paris previously, Pascal lived from the age of sixteen to that of
twenty-five; almost wholly educated by his father on account of
his precarious health. His mother died when he was eight years
old. Etienne Pascal was a pious but stern person, and by no
means disposed to entertain or allow any undue exaltation in
religion, refusing as long as he lived to allow his daughter
Jaqueline to take the veil. But he had the usual faiths and
superstitions of his time, and believing that his son's ill-health
arose from witchcraft, employed the old woman who was supposed
to have caused the malady to remove it, by herbs culled
before sunrise, and the expiatory death of a cat. This made a
great impression on his son, who in the "Thoughts" employs an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
ingenious argument to prove that wonders wrought by the invocation
of the devil are not, in the proper sense of the term,
miracles. At any rate the counter-charm was incomplete, as the
child's feeble health remained feeble to the end.</p>

<p>Intellectually, Blaise Pascal grew rapidly to the stature and
strength of a giant; his genius showing itself mainly in the
direction of mathematics; at the age of fifteen his studies on
conic sections were thought worthy to be read before the most
scientific men of Paris, and in after years of agonizing pain
mathematical research alone was able to calm him, and distract
his mind from himself. His actual reading was at all times
narrow, and his scholarship was not profound. In 1646, his
father, having broken his thigh at Rouen, came under the influence
of two members of the Jansenist school of thought at
that place, who attended him in his illness, and from that time
dated the more serious religious views of the family. Jaqueline
was from the first deeply affected by the more rigorous opinions
with which she came in contact. Forbidden to enter the
cloister, she lived at home as austere a life as though she had
been professed, but after her father's death won her brother's
reluctant consent to take the veil at Port Royal, and became
one of the strictest nuns of that rigid rule.</p>

<p>Blaise Pascal went through a double process of conversion.
When the family first fell under Jansenist influence he threw
himself so earnestly into the study of theology that he seriously
injured his frail health, and being advised to refrain from all
intellectual labour, he returned to the world of Paris, where his
friends the Duc de Roannez, the Chevalier de Méré and
M. Miton were among the best known and most fashionable
persons. His father's death put him in possession of a fair
fortune, which he used freely, not at all viciously, but with no
renunciation of the pleasures of society. There is some evidence
of a proposal that he should marry the Duc de Roannez' sister,
and no doubt with such a scheme before him he wrote his celebrated
"Discours sur les Passions de l'Amour." This, however,
resulted only in the conversion of the duke and his sister, the
latter of whom for a time, the former for the whole of his life,
remained subject to the religious feelings then excited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span></p>

<p>In the autumn of 1654, whether after deliverance in a dangerous
accident, or from some hidden cause of which nothing
can now be even surmised, there came a second sudden conversion
from which there was no return. That hour wrought a
complete change in Pascal's life; austerity, self-denial, absolute
obedience to his spiritual director, boundless alms-giving succeeded
to what at most had been a moderate and restrained use
of worldly pleasure, and he threw himself into the life, controversy
and interests of Port Royal, with all the passion of one
who was not only a new convert, but the champion of a society
into which those dearest to him had entered even more fully
than he. He became, for a time, one of the solitaries of Port
Royal before the close of that same year.</p>

<p>The Cistercian Abbey of Port Royal des Champs was situated
about eighteen miles from Paris. It had been founded early in
the thirteenth century, and would have faded away unremembered
but for the grandeur of its closing years. The rule of the
community had been greatly relaxed, but it was reformed with
extreme rigour by Jaqueline Arnauld, its young abbess, known
in religion as La Mère Angélique. The priest chosen as Director
of the community was Jean du Vergier de Hauranne, Abbé
de St. Cyran, a close friend of Cornelius Jansen, Bishop of
Ypres. They had together devoted themselves to the study of
Saint Augustine; and the "Augustinus," the work to which Jansen
gave his whole life, was planned with the assistance of St.
Cyran. Certain propositions drawn from this work were afterwards
condemned, and the controversy which raged between the
two schools of the Jesuits and the Jansenists divided itself into
two parts, first, whether the propositions were heretical, and
secondly, whether as a fact they were contained in, or could
fairly be deduced from, Jansen's book. The strife, which raged
with varying fortunes for many years, need not here detain us.</p>

<p>After the reform of Port Royal, and when the Society, however
assailed and in danger, was at the height of its renown, the
whole establishment consisted of two convents, the mother house
of Port Royal des Champs, and one in Paris to which was attached
a school for girls. To Port Royal des Champs, as to a
spiritual centre, and to be under the guidance of the three great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
directors, who in succession ruled the abbey, M. de St. Cyran,
M. Singlin, and M. de Saci, there came men and women, not
under monastic vows, but living for a time the monastic or even
the eremitical life. The women, for the most part, had rooms
in the convent, the men built rooms for themselves hard by, or
shared between them La Grange, a farm belonging to the abbey.
It need scarcely be said that in so strict a community the sexes
were wholly separate; a common worship, and the confidence of
the same confessor, together with similarity of views in religion,
were the ties which bound together the whole society.</p>

<p>When Pascal formally joined Port Royal, the Abbey and all
that was attached to it greatly needed aid from without. A
Bull in condemnation of Jansen had been gained from the Pope,
and a Formulary, minimising its effect as far as possible, was
drawn up by the General Assembly in France, which was ultimately
accepted by Port Royal itself. But if the Port Royalists
minimized the defeat, and, with great intellectual dexterity,
showed that the condemned propositions were not in precise
terms what they had held, and were not in Jansen's book, their
adversaries exaggerated the victory. A confessor in Paris refused
absolution to a parishioner because he had a Jansenist
living in his house, and had sent his grand-daughter to school
at Port Royal. Antoine Arnauld, known as Le Grand Arnauld,
brother of La Mère Angélique, himself in danger of condemnation
by the Sorbonne, drew up a statement of the case intended to
instruct the public on the points in dispute. On reading this to
the Port Royal solitaries before printing it, he saw that it would
not do, and turning to Pascal, who had then been a year under
M. Singlin's direction, he suggested to him as a younger man
with a lighter pen to see what he could do. The next day
Pascal produced the first of the "Provincial Letters," or to give
it the correct title, "A Letter written to a Provincial by one of
his friends." In these Letters Pascal formed his true style, and
took rank at once among the great French writers. They contributed
largely to turn the scale of feeling against his adversaries;
they, and an occurrence in which he saw the visible
finger of God, saved Port Royal for a time. But the history of
the "Provincial Letters" must be read elsewhere, as must also in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
its fulness the miracle of the Holy Thorn, on which a few words
are needed.</p>

<p>The "Provincial Letters" were in course of publication, but
M. Arnauld had been condemned by the Sorbonne just as the
first was issued, and his enemies said he was excommunicated,
which was not technically true; he was in danger of arrest, and
was in hiding; the solitaries of Port Royal were almost all dispersed;
the schools were thinned of their pupils and on the
point of closing, the confessors were about to be withdrawn
and the nuns sent to various other convents, when the miracle
took place. Marguerite Perier, a child of ten years old, daughter
of Pascal's elder sister, was one of the pupils at Port Royal in
Paris, not as yet dismissed to her home. She was tenderly nursed
by the nuns for an ulcer in the lachrymal gland, which had
destroyed the bones of the nose, and produced other horrors of
which there is no need to speak. A relic of the Saviour, one of the
thorns of his crown of mockery, which had been intrusted to the
nuns, was specially venerated during a service in its honour, and
as it would seem was passed from hand to hand in its reliquary.
When the turn of the scholars came, Sister Flavia, their mistress,
moved by a sudden impulse said, "My child, pray for your eye,"
and touched the ulcer with the reliquary. The child was cured,
and the effect on the community was immediate. The remaining
solitaries were not dispersed, some of those who had gone
returned, the confessors were not removed, the school was not
closed, and Port Royal was respited.</p>

<p>The miracle was to Pascal at once a solemn matter of religion
and a family occurrence; he took henceforward as his cognizance
an eye encircled with a crown of thorns and the motto
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Scio cui credidi</i>, he jotted down various thoughts on the
miracle, and the manner in which as it seemed to him God had
by it given as by "a voice of thunder" his judgment in favour of
Port Royal, and he sketched a plan of a work against atheists
and unbelievers. In the year between the spring of 1657, and
that of 1658, the last year of his good health, if that can be
called good which was at best but feeble, he indicated the plan,
and wrote the most finished paragraphs of his intended work.
The detached thoughts which make up the bulk of it were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
scribbled, as they occurred to him during the last four years of
his life, on scraps of paper, or on the margin of what he had
already written, often when he was quite incapable of sustained
employment. Many were dictated, some to friends, and some
to a servant who constantly attended him in his illness.</p>

<p>Towards the end of his life he was obliged to move into Paris
again, where he was carefully nursed by his sister Madame
Perrier, to whose house he was moved at the last, where he
died on August 9th, 1662, at the age of thirty-nine, having spent
his last years in an ecstasy of self-denial, of charity, and of
aspiration after God.</p>

<br />

<p>Not for six years after his death were his family and friends
able to consider in what form his unfinished work should be
given to the world. Then Port Royal had a breathing space,
what was known as the Peace of the Church was established by
Clement IX., and it was considered that the time had come to
set in order these precious fragments. The duty of giving an
author's works to the world as he left them was little understood
in those days, and the Duc de Roannez even suggested
that Pascal's whole work should be re-written on the lines he
had laid down. Some editing was, on all hands, allowed to be
needful; thus the arrangement of chapters, and the fragments
to be included in chapters, were matter for fair discussion. But
the committee of editors went further, and even when the text
had been settled by them, it had to undergo a further censorship
by various theologians. Finally, in January, 1670, the "Pensées"
appeared as a small duodecimo, with a preface by the Perrier
family, and no mention of Port Royal in the volume.</p>

<p>For a full account of this and other editions, the reader must
be referred to the preface to M. Molinier's edition, Paris, 1877-1879,
and to that of M. Faugère, Paris, 1844.</p>

<p>M. Victor Cousin was the first to draw attention to the need
of a new edition of Pascal in 1842. He showed that great
liberties had been taken with and suppressions made in the
text, and the labour to which he invited was first undertaken by
M. Prosper Faugère. M. Havet adopting his text departed
from his arrangement, reverted in great measure to that of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
old editors, and accompanied the whole by an excellent commentary
and notes, 2nd edition, Paris, 1866. M. Molinier has
again consulted the MSS. word for word, and while in a degree
following M. Faugère's arrangement has yet been guided by his
own skill and judgment. It must always be remembered that
each editor must necessarily follow his own judgment in regard
to the position he should give to fragments not placed by the
writer. But provided that an editor makes no changes merely
for the sake of change and that he loyally enters into the spirit of
his predecessors, each new comer, till the arrangement is finally
fixed, has a great advantage. Such an editor is M. Molinier,
and in his arrangement the text of Pascal would seem to be
mainly if not wholly fixed; so that for the first time we have
not only Pascal's "Thoughts," but we have them approximately
arranged as he designed to present them to his readers.</p>

<p>The course of an English translator is clear; his responsibility
is confined to deciding which text to follow, he has no right
to make one for himself. In the present edition, therefore,
M. Molinier's text and arrangement are scrupulously followed
except in two places. In regard to one, M. Molinier has himself
adopted a different reading in his notes made after the text
was printed, the second is an obvious misprint. Pascal's "Profession
of Faith," or "Amulet," is transferred from the place it
occupies in M. Molinier's edition to serve as an introduction to
the work, striking as it does the key-note to the "Thoughts."</p>

<p>Pascal's quotations from the Bible were made of course from
the Vulgate, but very often indeed from memory, and incorrectly,
while he often gave the substance alone of the passage he used.
No one version of the Bible therefore has been used exclusively,
but the Authorised Version and the Douai or Rheims versions
have been used as each in turn most nearly afforded the equivalent
of the quotations made by Pascal.</p>

<p>The notes are mainly based on those of MM. Faugère, Havet,
and Molinier.</p>

    <div>

<p class="noindent">Let them at least learn what is the Religion they assail,
before they assail it. If this religion claimed to have a clear
view of God, and to possess it openly and unveiled, then to say
that we see nothing in the world which manifests him with this
clearness would be to assail it. But since on the contrary it
affirms that men are in darkness and estranged from God, that
he has hidden himself from their knowledge, that the very
name he has given himself in the Scriptures is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Deus absconditus</i>;
and if indeed it aims equally at establishing these two points,
that God has set in the Church evident notes to enable those
who seek him in sincerity to recognise him, and that he has
nevertheless so concealed them that he can only be perceived by
those who seek him with their whole hearts; what advantages
it them, when, in their professed neglect of the search after truth,
they declare that nothing reveals it to them? For the very
obscurity in which they are, and for which they blame the
Church, does but establish one of the points which she maintains,
without affecting the other, and far from destroying,
establishes her doctrine.</p>

<p>In order to assail it they ought to urge that they have sought
everywhere with all their strength, and even in that which
the Church proposes for their instruction, but without avail.
Did they thus speak, they would indeed assail one of her claims.
But I hope here to show that no rational person can thus speak,
and I am even bold to say that no one has ever done so. We
know well enough how men of this temper behave. They believe
they have made great efforts for their instruction, when they have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
spent a few hours in reading some book of Scripture, and have
talked with some Ecclesiastic on the truths of the faith. Whereupon
they boast that they have in vain consulted books and men.
But indeed I will tell them what I have often said, that such
carelessness is intolerable. We are not here dealing with the
light interest of a stranger, that we should thus treat it; but
with that which concerns ourselves and our all.</p>

<p>The immortality of the soul is a matter of so great moment
to us, it touches us so deeply, that we must have lost all feeling
if we are careless of the truth about it. Our every action and
our every thought must take such different courses, according as
there are or are not eternal blessings for which to hope, that it is
impossible to take a single step with sense or judgment, save
in view of that point which ought to be our end and aim.</p>

<p>Thus our first interest and our first duty is to gain light on
this subject, whereon our whole conduct depends. Therefore
among unbelievers, I make a vast difference between those who
labour with all their power to gain instruction, and those who
live without taking trouble or thought for it.</p>

<p>I can have nothing but compassion for all who sincerely
lament their doubt, who look upon it as the worst of evils, and
who, sparing no pains to escape it, find in that endeavour their
principal and most serious occupation.</p>

<p>But as for those who pass their life without thought of the
ultimate goal of life, who, solely because they do not find
within themselves the light of conviction, neglect to seek it
elsewhere and to examine thoroughly whether the opinion in
question be among those which are popularly received with
credulous simplicity, or among those which, although in themselves
obscure, have yet a solid and indestructible basis,&mdash;of
those, I say, my thoughts are very different.</p>

<p>This neglect of a matter in which themselves are concerned,
their eternity, and their all, makes me angry rather than compassionate;
it astonishes and terrifies me, it is to me something
monstrous. I do not say this out of the pious zeal of a spiritual
devotion. I mean on the contrary that such a feeling should spring
from principles of human interest and self-love; and for this we
need see no more than what is seen by the least enlightened persons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>We need no great elevation of soul to understand that here
is no true and solid satisfaction, that all our pleasures are
but vanity, our evils infinite, and lastly that death, which
threatens us every moment, must infallibly and within a few
years place us in the dread alternative of being for ever either
annihilated or wretched.</p>

<p>Nothing is more real than this, nothing more terrible. Brave
it out as we may, that is yet the end which awaits the fairest
life in the world. Let us reflect on this, and then say if it be not
certain that there is no good in this life save in the hope of
another, that we are happy only in proportion as we approach it,
and that as there is no more sorrow for those who have an entire
assurance of eternity, so there is no happiness for those who
have not a ray of its light.</p>

<p>Assuredly then it is a great evil thus to be in doubt, but it is at
least an indispensable duty to seek when we are in such doubt;
he therefore who doubts and yet seeks not is at once thoroughly
unhappy and thoroughly unfair. And if at the same time he be
easy and content, profess to be so, and in fact pride himself
thereon; if even it be this very condition of doubt which forms
the subject of his joy and boasting, I have no terms in which
to describe a creature so extravagant.</p>

<p>Whence come such feelings? What delight can we find in
the expectation of nothing but unavailing misery? What cause of
boasting that we are in impenetrable darkness? How can such
an argument as the following occur to a reasoning man?</p>

<p>"I know not who has sent me into the world, nor what the world
is, nor what I myself am; I am terribly ignorant of every thing;
I know not what my body is, nor my senses, nor my soul, nor
even that part of me which thinks what I say, which reflects on
all and on itself, yet is as ignorant of itself as of all beside. I
see those dreadful spaces of the universe which close me in, and
I find myself fixed in one corner of this vast expanse, without
knowing why I am set in this place rather than elsewhere, nor
why this moment of time given me for life is assigned to this
point rather than another of the whole Eternity which was before
me or which shall be after me. I see nothing but infinities
on every side, which close me round as an atom, and as a shadow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
which endures but for an instant and returns no more. I know
only that I must shortly die, but what I know the least is this
very death which I cannot avoid.</p>

<p>"As I know not whence I come, so I know not whither I go;
only this I know, that on departing this world, I shall either fall
for ever into nothingness, or into the hands of an offended God,
without knowing which of these two conditions shall eternally be
my lot. Such is my state, full of weakness and uncertainty;
from all which I conclude that I ought to pass all the days of
my life without thought of searching for what must happen to
me. Perhaps I might find some ray of light in my doubts, but I
will not take the trouble, nor stir a foot to seek it; and after
treating with scorn those who are troubled with this care, I will
go without foresight and without fear to make trial of the grand
event, and allow myself to be led softly on to death, uncertain
of the eternity of my future condition."</p>

<p>Who would wish to have for his friend a man who should thus
speak; who would choose him rather than another for advice in
business; who would turn to him in sorrow? And indeed to what
use in life could we put him?</p>

<p>In truth, it is the glory of Religion to have for enemies men
so unreasoning, whose opposition is so little dangerous to her,
that it the rather serves to establish her truths. For the
Christian faith goes mainly to the establishment of these two
points, the corruption of nature, and the Redemption by Jesus
Christ. Now I maintain that if these men serve not to demonstrate
the truth of Redemption by the holiness of their morals,
they at least serve admirably to show the corruption of nature
by sentiments so unnatural.</p>

<p>Nothing is so important to man as his condition, nothing so formidable
to him as eternity; and thus it is not natural there should
be men indifferent to the loss of their being, and to the peril of
an endless woe. They are quite other men in regard to all
else; they fear the veriest trifles, they foresee them, they feel
them; and the very man who spends so many days and nights
in rage and despair for the loss of office or for some imaginary
insult to his honour, is the same who, without disquiet and without
emotion, knows that he must lose all by death. It is a monstrous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
thing to see in one and the same heart and at the same
time this sensibility to the meanest, and this strange insensibility
to the greatest matters. It is an incomprehensible
spell, a supernatural drowsiness, which denotes as its cause an
all powerful force.</p>

<p>There must be a strange revolution in the nature of man,
before he can glory at being in a state to which it seems incredible
that any should attain. Experience however has shown
me a large number of such men, a surprising fact did we not
know that the greater part of those who meddle with the matter
are not as a fact what they declare themselves. They are
people who have been told that the manners of good society
consist in such daring. This they call shaking off the yoke, this
they try to imitate. Yet it would not be difficult to convince them
how much they deceive themselves in thus seeking esteem. Not
so is it acquired, even among those men of the world who judge
wisely, and who know that the only way of worldly success is
to show ourselves honourable, faithful, of sound judgment, and
capable of useful service to a friend; because by nature men
love only what may prove useful to them. Now in what way does
it advantage us to hear a man say he has at last shaken off the
yoke, that he does not believe there is a God who watches his
actions, that he considers himself the sole master of his conduct
and accountable for it only to himself. Does he think that thus
he has brought us to have henceforward confidence in him, and to
look to him for comfort, counsel and succour in every need of life?
Do they think to delight us when they declare that they hold
our soul to be but a little wind or smoke, nay, when they tell
us so in a tone of proud content? Is this a thing to assert
gaily, and not rather to say sadly as the saddest thing in all
the world?</p>

<p>Did they think on it seriously, they would see that this is so
great a mistake, so contrary to good sense, so opposed to
honourable conduct, so remote in every respect from that
good breeding at which they aim, that they would choose
rather to restore than to corrupt those who might have any
inclination to follow them. And indeed if they are obliged to
give an account of their opinions, and of the reasons they have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
for doubts about Religion, they will say things so weak and base,
as rather to persuade the contrary. It was once happily said
to such an one, "If you continue to talk thus you will really make
me a Christian." And the speaker was right, for who would not
be horrified at entertaining opinions in which he would have
such despicable persons as his associates!</p>

<p>Thus those who only feign these opinions would be very
unhappy were they to put force on their natural disposition in
order to make themselves the most inconsequent of men. If, in
their inmost hearts, they are troubled at their lack of light, let them
not dissemble: the avowal will bring no shame; the only shame is
to be shameless. Nothing betrays so much weakness of mind as
not to apprehend the misfortune of a man without God, nothing
is so sure a token of an evil disposition of heart as not to desire
the truth of eternal promises, nothing is more cowardly than to
fight against God. Let them therefore leave these impieties to
persons who are so ill-bred as to be really capable of them,
let them at least be men of honour if they cannot be Christians,
and lastly, let them recognise that there are but two
classes of men who can be called reasonable; those who serve
God with their whole heart because they know him, or those who
seek him with their whole heart because they know him not.</p>

<p>But as for those who live without knowing him and without
seeking him, they judge themselves to deserve their own care so
little, that they are not worthy the care of others, and it needs
all the charity of the Religion they despise, not to despise
them so utterly as to abandon them to their madness. But since
this Religion obliges us to look on them, while they are in this
life, as always capable of illuminating grace, and to believe that
in a short while they may be more full of faith than ourselves,
while we on the other hand may fall into the blindness which
now is theirs, we ought to do for them what we would they should
do for us were we in their place, and to entreat them to take pity
on themselves and advance at least a few steps, if perchance they
may find the light. Let them give to reading these words a few
of the hours which otherwise they spend so unprofitably: with
whatever aversion they set about it they may perhaps gain
something; at least they cannot be great losers. But if any bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
to the task perfect sincerity and a true desire to meet with truth,
I despair not of their satisfaction, nor of their being convinced of
so divine a Religion by the proofs which I have here gathered
up, and have set forth in somewhat the following order....</p>

<p>Before entering upon the proofs of the Christian Religion, I
find it necessary to set forth the unfairness of men who live indifferent
to the search for truth in a matter which is so important to
them, and which touches them so nearly.</p>

<p>Among all their errors this doubtless is the one which most
proves them to be fools and blind, and in which it is most easy
to confound them by the first gleam of common sense, and by our
natural feelings.</p>

<p>For it is not to be doubted that this life endures but for an
instant, that the state of death is eternal, whatever may be its
nature, and that thus all our actions and all our thoughts must take
such different courses according to the state of that eternity, as to
render it impossible to take a single step with sense and judgment,
save in view of that point which ought to be our end and aim.</p>

<p>Nothing is more clear than this, and therefore by all principles
of reason the conduct of men is most unreasonable if they do
not alter their course. Hence we may judge concerning those
who live without thinking of the ultimate goal of life, who
allow themselves to be guided by their inclinations and their pleasures
without thought or disquiet, and, as if they could annihilate
eternity by turning their minds from it, consider only how they
may make themselves happy for the moment.</p>

<p>Yet this eternity exists; and death the gate of eternity, which
threatens them every hour, must in a short while infallibly reduce
them to the dread necessity of being through eternity either
nothing or miserable, without knowing which of these eternities
is for ever prepared for them.</p>

<p>This is a doubt which has terrible consequences. They
are in danger of an eternity of misery, and thereupon, as if the
matter were not worth the trouble, they care not to examine
whether this is one of those opinions which men in general
receive with a too credulous facility, or among those which, themselves
obscure, have yet a solid though concealed foundation.
Thus they know not whether the matter be true or false, nor if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the proofs be strong or weak. They have them before their
eyes, they refuse to look at them, and in that ignorance they
choose to do all that will bring them into this misfortune if it
exist, to wait for death to verify it, and to be in the meantime
thoroughly satisfied with their state, openly avowing and
even making boast of it. Can we think seriously on the importance
of this matter without being revolted at conduct so
extravagant?</p>

<p>Such rest in ignorance is a monstrous thing, and they who
live in it ought to be made aware of its extravagance and
stupidity, by having it revealed to them, that they may be confounded
by the sight of their own folly. For this is how men
reason when they choose to live ignorant of what they are and
do not seek to be enlightened. "I know not," say they....</p>

<p class="noindent">To doubt is then a misfortune, but to seek when in doubt is an indispensable
duty. So he who doubts and seeks not is at once unfortunate
and unfair. If at the same time he is gay and presumptuous, I have
no terms in which to describe a creature so extravagant.</p>

<br />

<p>A fine subject of rejoicing and boasting, with the head uplifted in
such a fashion.... Therefore let us rejoice; I see not the conclusion,
since it is uncertain, and we shall then see what will become of us.</p>

<br />

<p>Is it courage in a dying man that he dare, in his weakness and agony,
face an almighty and eternal God?</p>

<br />

<p>Were I in that state I should be glad if any one would pity my folly,
and would have the goodness to deliver me in despite of myself!</p>

<br />

<p>Yet it is certain that man has so fallen from nature that there is in his
heart a seed of joy in that very fact.</p>

<br />

<p>A man in a dungeon, who knows not whether his doom is fixed, who
has but one hour to learn it, and this hour enough, should he know that
it is fixed, to obtain its repeal, would act against nature did he employ
that hour, not in learning his sentence, but in playing piquet.</p>

<p>So it is against nature that man, etc. It is to weight the hand of
God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<br />

<p>Thus not the zeal alone of those who seek him proves God, but the
blindness of those who seek him not.</p>

<br />

<p>We run carelessly to the precipice after having veiled our eyes to
hinder us from seeing it.</p>

<br />

<p>Between us and hell or heaven, there is nought but life, the frailest
thing in all the world.</p>

<br />

<p>If it be a supernatural blindness to live without seeking to know
what we are, it is a terrible blindness to live ill while believing in
God.</p>

<br />

<p>The sensibility of man to trifles, and his insensibility to great things,
is the mark of a strange inversion.</p>

<br />

<p>This shows that there is nothing to say to them, not that we despise
them, but because they have no common sense: God must touch them.</p>

<br />

<p>We must pity both parties, but for the one we must feel the pity
born of tenderness, and for the other the pity born of contempt.</p>

<br />

<p>We must indeed be of that religion which man despises that we may
not despise men.</p>

<br />

<p>People of that kind are academicians and scholars, and that is the
worst kind of men that I know.</p>

<br />

<p>I do not gather that by system, but by the way in which the heart of
man is made.</p>

<br />

<p>To reproach Miton, that he is not troubled when God will reproach
him.</p>

<br />

<p>Is this a thing to say with joy? It is a thing we ought then to say
with sadness.</p>

<br />

<p>Nothing is so important as this, yet we neglect this only.</p>

<br />

<p>This is all that a man could do were he assured of the falsehood of
that news, and even then he ought not to be joyful, but downcast.</p>

<br />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>... Suppose an heir finds the title-deeds of his house. Will he say,
"Perhaps they are forgeries?" and neglect to examine them?</p>

<br />

<p>We must not say that this is a mark of reason.</p>

<br />

<p>To be so insensible as to despise interesting things, and to become
insensible to the point which most interests us.</p>

<br />

<p>What then shall we conclude of all these obscurities, if not our own
unworthiness?</p>

<p class="noindent">To speak of those who have treated of the knowledge of self, of
the divisions of Charron which sadden and weary us, of the
confusion of Montaigne; that he was aware he had no definite
system, and tried to evade the difficulty by leaping from subject
to subject; that he sought to be fashionable.</p>

<p>His foolish project of self-description, and this not casually
and against his maxims, since everybody may make mistakes,
but by his maxims themselves, and by his main and principal
design. For to say foolish things by chance and weakness is an
ordinary evil, but to say them designedly is unbearable, and to
say of such that....</p>

<br />

<p><em>Montaigne.</em>&mdash;Montaigne's defects are great. Lewd expressions.
This is bad, whatever Mademoiselle de Gournay may
say. He is credulous, <em>people without eyes</em>; ignorant, <em>squaring
the circle, a greater world</em>. His opinions on suicide and on
death. He suggests a carelessness about salvation, <em>without fear
and without repentance</em>. Since his book was not written with a
religious intent, it was not his duty to speak of religion; but
it is always a duty not to turn men from it. We may excuse
his somewhat lax and licentious opinions on some relations of
life, but not his thoroughly pagan opinions on death, for a man
must give over piety altogether, if he does not at least wish
to die like a Christian. Now through the whole of his book he
looks forward to nothing but a soft and indolent death.</p>

<br />

<p>What good there is in Montaigne can only have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
acquired with difficulty. What is evil in him, I mean apart
from his morality, could have been corrected in a moment, if
any one had told him he was too prolix and too egoistical.</p>

<br />

<p>Not in Montaigne, but in myself, I find all that I see in him.</p>

<br />

<p>Let no one say I have said nothing new, the disposition of
my matter is new. In playing tennis, two men play with the
same ball, but one places it better.</p>

<p>It might as truly be said that my words have been used before.
And if the same thoughts in a different arrangement do not form
a different discourse, so neither do the same words in a different
arrangement form different thoughts.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>MAN'S DISPROPORTION.</em></a></h3>
</div>

    <div>

<p class="noindent">This is where our intuitive knowledge leads us. If it be not
true, there is no truth in man; and if it be, he finds therein a
great reason for humiliation, because he must abase himself
in one way or another. And since he cannot exist without
such knowledge, I wish that before entering on deeper researches
into nature he would consider her seriously and
at leisure, that he would examine himself also, and knowing
what proportion there is.... Let man then contemplate the
whole realm of nature in its full and exalted majesty, and
turn his eyes from the low objects which hem him round;
let him observe that brilliant light set like an eternal lamp to
illumine the universe, let the earth appear to him a point in
comparison with the vast circle described by that sun, and
let him see with amazement that even this vast circle is itself
but a fine point in regard to that described by the stars revolving
in the firmament. If our view be arrested there, let imagination
pass beyond, and it will sooner exhaust the power of thinking
than nature that of giving scope for thought. The whole visible
world is but an imperceptible speck in the ample bosom of
nature. No idea approaches it. We may swell our conceptions
beyond all imaginable space, yet bring forth only atoms in
comparison with the reality of things. It is an infinite sphere,
the centre of which is every where, the circumference no where.
It is, in short, the greatest sensible mark of the almighty power
of God, in that thought let imagination lose itself.</p>

<p>Then, returning to himself, let man consider his own
being compared with all that is; let him regard himself as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
wandering in this remote province of nature; and from the little
dungeon in which he finds himself lodged, I mean the universe,
let him learn to set a true value on the earth, on its
kingdoms, its cities, and on himself.</p>

<p>What is a man in the infinite? But to show him another
prodigy no less astonishing, let him examine the most delicate
things he knows. Let him take a mite which in its minute body
presents him with parts incomparably more minute; limbs with
their joints, veins in the limbs, blood in the veins, humours in
the blood, drops in the humours, vapours in the drops; let him,
again dividing these last, exhaust his power of thought; let
the last point at which he arrives be that of which we speak,
and he will perhaps think that here is the extremest diminutive
in nature. Then I will open before him therein a new abyss. I
will paint for him not only the visible universe, but all that he can
conceive of nature's immensity in the enclosure of this diminished
atom. Let him therein see an infinity of universes of which each
has its firmament, its planets, its earth, in the same proportion
as in the visible world; in each earth animals, and at the last the
mites, in which he will come upon all that was in the first, and
still find in these others the same without end and without
cessation; let him lose himself in wonders as astonishing in
their minuteness as the others in their immensity; for who will
not be amazed at seeing that our body, which before was imperceptible
in the universe, itself imperceptible in the bosom of the
whole, is now a colossus, a world, a whole, in regard to the
nothingness to which we cannot attain.</p>

<p>Whoso takes this survey of himself will be terrified at the
thought that he is upheld in the material being, given him by
nature, between these two abysses of the infinite and nothing,
he will tremble at the sight of these marvels; and I think that as
his curiosity changes into wonder, he will be more disposed to
contemplate them in silence than to search into them with
presumption.</p>

<p>For after all what is man in nature? A nothing in regard to
the infinite, a whole in regard to nothing, a mean between
nothing and the whole; infinitely removed from understanding
either extreme. The end of things and their beginnings are invincibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
hidden from him in impenetrable secrecy, he is equally
incapable of seeing the nothing whence he was taken, and the
infinite in which he is engulfed.</p>

<p>What shall he do then, but discern somewhat of the middle
of things in an eternal despair of knowing either their beginning
or their end? All things arise from nothing, and tend towards
the infinite. Who can follow their marvellous course? The
author of these wonders can understand them, and none but he.</p>

<p>Of these two infinites in nature, the infinitely great and the
infinitely little, man can more easily conceive the great.</p>

<p>Because they have not considered these infinities, men have
rashly plunged into the research of nature, as though they bore
some proportion to her.</p>

<p>It is strange that they have wished to understand the origin
of all that is, and thence to attain to the knowledge of the
whole, with a presumption as infinite as their object. For
there is no doubt that such a design cannot be formed without
presumption or without a capacity as infinite as nature.</p>

<p>If we are well informed, we understand that nature having
graven her own image and that of her author on all things, they
are almost all partakers of her double infinity. Thus we see
that all the sciences are infinite in the extent of their researches,
for none can doubt that geometry, for instance, has an infinite
infinity of problems to propose. They are also infinite in the
number and in the nicety of their premisses, for it is evident
that those which are finally proposed are not self-supporting,
but are based on others, which again having others as their
support have no finality.</p>

<p>But we make some apparently final to the reason, just as in
regard to material things we call that an indivisible point beyond
which our senses can no longer perceive any thing, though by its
nature this also is infinitely divisible.</p>

<p>Of these two scientific infinities, that of greatness is the most
obvious to the senses, and therefore few persons have made
pretensions to universal knowledge. "I will discourse of the
all," said Democritus.</p>

<p>But beyond the fact that it is a small thing to speak of it
simply, without proving and knowing, it is nevertheless impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
to do so, the infinite multitude of things being so hidden,
that all we can express by word or thought is but an invisible
trace of them. Hence it is plain how foolish, vain, and ignorant
is that title of some books: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">De omni scibili</i>.</p>

<p>But the infinitely little is far less evident. Philosophers have
much more frequently asserted they have attained it, yet in that
very point they have all stumbled. This has given occasion to
such common titles as <cite>The Origin of Creation</cite>, <cite>The Principles of
Philosophy</cite>, and the like, as presumptuous in fact though not in
appearance as that dazzling one, <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De omni scibili</cite>.</p>

<p>We naturally think that we can more easily reach the centre
of things than embrace their circumference. The visible
bulk of the world visibly exceeds us, but as we exceed little
things, we think ourselves more capable of possessing them.
Yet we need no less capacity to attain the nothing than the
whole. Infinite capacity is needed for both, and it seems to me
that whoever shall have understood the ultimate principles of
existence might also attain to the knowledge of the infinite.
The one depends on the other, and one leads to the other.
Extremes meet and reunite by virtue of their distance, to find
each other in God, and in God alone.</p>

<p>Let us then know our limits; we are something, but we are
not all. What existence we have conceals from us the knowledge
of first principles which spring from the nothing, while the pettiness
of that existence hides from us the sight of the infinite.</p>

<p>In the order of intelligible things our intelligence holds the
same position as our body holds in the vast extent of nature.</p>

<p>Restricted in every way, this middle state between two
extremes is common to all our weaknesses.</p>

<p>Our senses can perceive no extreme. Too much noise deafens
us, excess of light blinds us, too great distance or nearness equally
interfere with our vision, prolixity or brevity equally obscure a
discourse, too much truth overwhelms us. I know even those
who cannot understand that if four be taken from nothing
nothing remains. First principles are too plain for us, superfluous
pleasure troubles us. Too many concords are unpleasing
in music, and too many benefits annoy, we wish to have wherewithal
to overpay our debt. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Beneficia eo usque læta sunt dum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
videntur exsolvi posse; ubi multum antevenere, pro gratia
odium redditur.</i></p>

<p>We feel neither extreme heat nor extreme cold. Qualities in
excess are inimical to us and not apparent to the senses, we
do not feel but are passive under them. The weakness of youth
and age equally hinder the mind, as also too much and too
little teaching....</p>

<p>In a word, all extremes are for us as though they were not;
and we are not, in regard to them: they escape us, or we them.</p>

<p>This is our true state; this is what renders us incapable
both of certain knowledge and of absolute ignorance. We sail
on a vast expanse, ever uncertain, ever drifting, hurried from
one to the other goal. If we think to attach ourselves firmly
to any point, it totters and fails us; if we follow, it eludes our
grasp, and <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber Note: Original text 'flies us'">flies from us</ins>, vanishing for ever. Nothing stays for us.
This is our natural condition, yet always the most contrary
to our inclination; we burn with desire to find a steadfast place
and an ultimate fixed basis whereon we may build a tower to
reach the infinite. But our whole foundation breaks up, and
earth opens to the abysses.</p>

<p>We may not then look for certainty or stability. Our reason
is always deceived by changing shows, nothing can fix the
finite between the two infinites, which at once enclose and fly
from it.</p>

<p>If this be once well understood I think that we shall rest, each
in the state wherein nature has placed him. This element which
falls to us as our lot being always distant from either extreme,
it matters not that a man should have a trifle more knowledge
of the universe. If he has it, he but begins a little higher. He is
always infinitely distant from the end, and the duration of our
life is infinitely removed from eternity, even if it last ten years
longer.</p>

<p>In regard to these infinites all finites are equal, and I see
not why we should fix our imagination on one more than on
another. The only comparison which we can make of ourselves
to the finite troubles us.</p>

<p>Were man to begin with the study of himself, he would see
how incapable he is of proceeding further. How can a part know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the whole? But he may perhaps aspire to know at least the parts
with which he has proportionate relation. But the parts of the
world are so linked and related, that I think it impossible to
know one without another, or without the whole.</p>

<p>Man, for instance, is related to all that he knows. He needs
place wherein to abide, time through which to exist, motion
in order to live; he needs constituent elements, warmth and food
to nourish him, air to breathe. He sees light, he feels bodies,
he contracts an alliance with all that is.</p>

<p>To know man then it is necessary to understand how it
comes that he needs air to breathe, and to know the air we must
understand how it has relation to the life of man, etc.</p>

<p>Flame cannot exist without air, therefore to know one, we must
know the other.</p>

<p>All that exists then is both cause and effect, dependent and
supporting, mediate and immediate, and all is held together by
a natural though imperceptible bond, which unites things most
distant and most different. I hold it impossible to know the parts
without knowing the whole, or to know the whole without
knowing the parts in detail.</p>

<p>I hold it impossible to know one alone without all the others,
that is to say impossible purely and absolutely.</p>

<p>The eternity of things in themselves or in God must also
confound our brief duration. The fixed and constant immobility
of Nature in comparison with the continual changes which
take place in us must have the same effect.</p>

<p>And what completes our inability to know things is that they
are in their essence simple, whereas we are composed of two
opposite natures differing in kind, soul and body. For it is impossible
that our reasoning part should be other than spiritual; and
should any allege that we are simply material, this would far
more exclude us from the knowledge of things, since it is
an inconceivable paradox to affirm that matter can know
itself, and it is not possible for us to know how it should know
itself.</p>

<p>So, were we simply material, we could know nothing whatever,
and if we are composed of spirit and matter we cannot perfectly
know what is simple, whether it be spiritual or material. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
how should we know matter distinctly, since our being, which
acts on this knowledge, is partly spiritual, and how should we
know spiritual substances clearly since we have a body which
weights us, and drags us down to earth.</p>

<p>Moreover what completes our inability is the simplicity of
things compared with our double and complex nature. To
dispute this point were an invincible absurdity, for it is as absurd
as impious to deny that man is composed of two parts, differing
in their nature, soul and body. This renders us unable to
know all things; for if this complexity be denied, and it be
asserted that we are entirely material, it is plain that matter
is incapable of knowing matter. Nothing is more impossible
than this.</p>

<p>Let us conceive then that this mixture of spirit and clay throws
us out of proportion....</p>

<p>Hence it comes that almost all philosophers have confounded
different ideas, and speak of material things in spiritual phrase,
and of spiritual things in material phrase. For they say boldly
that bodies have a tendency to fall, that they seek after their
centre, that they fly from destruction, that they fear a void, that
they have inclinations, sympathies, antipathies; and all of these
are spiritual qualities. Again, in speaking of spirits, they conceive
of them as in a given spot, or as moving from place to
place; qualities which belong to matter alone.</p>

<p>Instead of receiving the ideas of these things simply, we colour
them with our own qualities, and stamp with our complex being
all the simple things which we contemplate.</p>

<p>Who would not think, when we declare that all that is consists
of mind and matter, that we really understood this combination?
Yet it is the one thing we least understand. Man is
to himself the most marvellous object in Nature, for he cannot
conceive what matter is, still less what is mind, and less than all
how a material body should be united to a mind. This is the
crown of all his difficulties, yet it is his very being: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Modus quo
corporibus adhæret spiritus comprehendi ab homine non potest
et hoc tamen homo est</i>.</p>

<p>These are some of the causes which render man so totally
unable to know nature. For nature has a twofold infinity, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
is finite and limited. Nature is permanent, and continues in one
stay; he is fleeting and mortal. All things fail and change each
instant, he sees them only as they pass, they have their beginning
and end, he conceives neither the one nor the other. They are
simple, he is composed of two different natures. And to complete
the proof of our weakness, I will finish by this reflection
on our natural condition. In a word, to complete the proof of
our weakness, I will end with these two considerations....</p>

<br />

<p>The nature of man may be considered in two ways, one according
to its end, and then it is great and incomparable; the other
according to popular opinion, as we judge of the nature of a
horse or a dog, by popular opinion which discerns in it the
power of speed, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">et animum arcendi</i>; and then man is abject and
vile. These are the two ways which make us judge of it so differently
and which cause such disputes among philosophers.</p>

<p>For one denies the supposition of the other; one says, <em>He was
not born for such an end, for all his actions are repugnant to it</em>;
the other says, <em>He cannot gain his end when he commits base deeds</em>.</p>

<p>Two things instruct man about his whole nature, instinct and
experience.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Inconstancy.</em>&mdash;We think we are playing on ordinary organs
when we play upon man. Men are organs indeed, but fantastic,
changeable, and various, with pipes not arranged in due succession.
Those who understand only how to play upon ordinary
organs make no harmonies on these. We should know where
are the....</p>

<br />

<p><em>Nature.</em>&mdash;Nature has placed us so truly in the centre, that if
we alter one side of the balance we alter also the other. This
makes me believe that there is a mechanism in our brain, so adjusted,
that who touches one touches also the contrary spring.</p>

<br />

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lustravit lampade terras.</i>&mdash;The weather and my moods have
little in common. I have my foggy and my fine days within me,
whether my affairs go well or ill has little to do with the matter.
I sometimes strive against my luck, the glory of subduing it
makes me subdue it gaily, whereas I am sometimes wearied in
the midst of my good luck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<br />

<p>It is difficult to submit anything to the judgment of a second
person without prejudicing him by the way in which we submit it.
If we say, "I think it beautiful, I think it obscure," or the like, we
either draw the imagination to that opinion, or irritate it to form
the contrary. It is better to say nothing, so that the other may
judge according to what really is, that is to say, as it then is, and
according as the other circumstances which are not of our making
have placed it. We at least shall have added nothing of our
own, except that silence produces an effect, according to the turn
and the interpretation which the other is inclined to give it, or as
he may conjecture it, from gestures or countenance, or from the
tone of voice, if he be a physiognomist; so difficult is it not to oust
the judgment from its natural seat, or rather so rarely is it firm
and stable!</p>

<br />

<p>The spirit of this sovereign judge of the world is not so
independent but that it is liable to be troubled by the first
disturbance about him. The noise of a cannon is not needed to
break his train of thought, it need only be the creaking of a
weathercock or a pulley. Do not be astonished if at this moment
he argues incoherently, a fly is buzzing about his ears, and that
is enough to render him incapable of sound judgment. Would
you have him arrive at truth, drive away that creature which
holds his reason in check, and troubles that powerful intellect
which gives laws to towns and kingdoms. Here is a droll kind
of god! <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">O ridicolosissimo eroe!</i></p>

<br />

<p>The power of flies, which win battles, hinder our soul from
action, devour our body.</p>

<br />

<p>When we are too young our judgment is at fault, so also when
we are too old.</p>

<p>If we take not thought enough, or too much, on any matter,
we are obstinate and infatuated.</p>

<p>He that considers his work so soon as it leaves his hands, is
prejudiced in its favour, he that delays his survey too long,
cannot regain the spirit of it.</p>

<p>So with pictures seen from too near or too far; there is but one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
precise point from which to look at them, all others are too near
or too far, too high or too low. Perspective determines that
precise point in the art of painting. But who shall determine
it in truth or morals?</p>

<br />

<p>When I consider the short duration of my life, swallowed up
in the eternity before and after, the small space which I fill, or
even can see, engulfed in the infinite immensity of spaces whereof
I know nothing, and which know nothing of me, I am terrified,
and wonder that I am here rather than there, for there is no
reason why here rather than there, or now rather than then.
Who has set me here? By whose order and design have this
place and time been destined for me?&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Memoria hospitis unius
diei prætereuntis</i>.</p>

<br />

<p>It is not well to be too much at liberty. It is not well to have
all we want.</p>

<br />

<p>How many kingdoms know nothing of us!</p>

<p>The eternal silence of these infinite spaces alarms me.</p>

<br />

<p>Nothing more astonishes me than to see that men are not
astonished at their own weakness. They act seriously, and
every one follows his own mode of life, not because it is, as a
fact, good to follow, being the custom, but as if each man knew
certainly where are reason and justice. They find themselves
constantly deceived, and by an amusing humility always imagine
that the fault is in themselves, and not in the art which all profess
to understand. But it is well there are so many of this kind
of people in the world, who are not sceptics for the glory of
scepticism, to show that man is thoroughly capable of the most
extravagant opinions, because he is capable of believing that his
weakness is not natural and inevitable, but that, on the contrary,
his wisdom comes by nature.</p>

<p>Nothing fortifies scepticism more than that there are some
who are not sceptics. If all were so, they would be wrong.</p>

<br />

<p>Two infinites, a mean. If we read too quickly or too slowly,
we understand nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<br />

<p>Too much and too little wine. Give a man none, he cannot
find truth, give him too much, the same.</p>

<br />

<p>Chance gives thoughts, and chance takes them away; there is
no art for keeping or gaining them.</p>

<p>A thought has escaped me. I would write it down. I write
instead, that it has escaped me.</p>

<br />

<p>In writing down my thought it now and then escapes me, but
this reminds me of my weakness, which I constantly forget.
This teaches me as much as my forgotten thought, for my whole
study is to know my nothingness.</p>

<br />

<p>Are men so strong, as to be insensible to all which affects
them? Let us try them in the loss of goods or honour. Ah! the
charm is worked.</p>

<br />

<p>To fear death out of danger, and not in danger, for we must
be men.</p>

<p>Sudden death is the only thing to fear, therefore confessors
live in the houses of the great.</p>

<br />

<p>We know ourselves so little, that many think themselves near
death when they are perfectly well, and many think themselves
well when they are near death, since they do not feel the fever
at hand, or the abscess about to form.</p>

<br />

<p>Why is my knowledge so restricted, or my height, or my life to
a hundred years rather than to a thousand? What was nature's
reason for giving me such length of days, and for choosing this
number rather than another, in that infinity where there is no
reason to choose one more than another, since none is preferable
to another?</p>

<br />

<p>The nature of man is not always to go forward, it has its
advances and retreats.</p>

<p>Fever has its hot and cold fits, and the cold proves as well as
the hot how great is the force of the fever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<br />

<p>The inventions of men from age to age follow the same plan.
It is the same with the goodness and the wickedness of the world
in general.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Plerumque gratæ principibus vices.</i></p>

<br />

<p>The strength of a man's virtue must not be measured by his
occasional efforts, but by his ordinary life.</p>

<br />

<p>Those great spiritual efforts to which the soul sometimes
attains are things on which it takes no permanent hold. It
leaps to them, not as to a throne, for ever, but only for an
instant.</p>

<br />

<p>I do not admire the excess of a virtue as of valour, unless I
see at the same time the excess of the opposite virtue, as
in Epaminondas, who had exceeding valour and exceeding
humanity, for otherwise we do not rise, but fall. Grandeur is not
shown by being at one extremity, but in touching both at once,
and filling the whole space between. But perhaps this is only a
sudden motion of the soul from one to the other extreme, and in
fact it is always at one point only, as when a firebrand is whirled.
Be it so, but at least this marks the agility if not the magnitude
of the soul.</p>

<br />

<p>We do not remain virtuous by our own power, but by the
counterpoise of two opposite vices, we remain standing as between
two contrary winds; take away one of these vices, we fall
into the other.</p>

<br />

<p>When we would pursue the virtues to their extremes on either
side, vices present themselves, which insinuate themselves insensibly
there, in their insensible course towards the infinitely
great, so that we lose ourselves in vices, and no longer see virtues.</p>

<br />

<p>It is not shameful to man to yield to pain, and it is shameful
to yield to pleasure. This is not because pain comes from without
us, while we seek pleasure, for we may seek pain, and yield
to it willingly without this kind of baseness. How comes it then
that reason finds it glorious in us to yield under the assaults of
pain, and shameful to yield under the assaults of pleasure?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
It is because pain does not tempt and attract us. We ourselves
choose it voluntarily, and will that it have dominion over
us. We are thus masters of the situation, and so far man yields
to himself, but in pleasure man yields to pleasure. Now only
mastery and empire bring glory, and only slavery causes shame.</p>

<br />

<p>All things may prove fatal to us, even those made to serve us,
as in nature walls may kill us and stairs may kill us, if we
walk not aright.</p>

<p>The slightest movement affects all nature, the whole sea
changes because of a rock. Thus in grace, the most trifling
action has effect on everything by its consequences; therefore
everything is important.</p>

<br />

<p>Provided we know each man's ruling passion we are sure of
pleasing him; yet each man has his fancies, contrary to his real
good, even in the very idea he forms of good; a strange fact
which puts all out of tune.</p>

<br />

<p>When our passions lead us to any act we forget our duty. If
we like a book we read it, when we should be doing something
else. But as a reminder we ought to propose to ourselves to do
something distasteful; we then excuse ourselves that we have
something else to do, and thus remember our duty.</p>

<br />

<p>Sneezing absorbs all the faculties of the soul, as do certain
bodily functions, but we do not draw therefrom the same conclusions
against the greatness of man, because it is against his will.
And if we make ourselves sneeze we do so against our will. It
is not in view of the act itself, but for another end, and so it is
not a mark of the weakness of man, and of his slavery to that act.</p>

<br />

<p>Scaramouch, who thinks of one thing only.</p>

<p>The doctor, who speaks for a quarter of an hour after he has
said all he has to say, so full is he of the desire of talking.</p>

<p>The parrot's beak, which he dries though it is clean already.</p>

<br />

<p>The sense of falseness in present pleasures, and our ignorance
of the vanity of absent pleasures, are the causes of inconstancy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<br />

<p>He no longer loves the person he loved ten years ago. I can
well believe it. She is no longer the same, nor is he. He was
young, and so was she; she is quite different. He would
perhaps love her still were she what she then was.</p>

<br />

<p>Reasons, seen from afar, appear to restrict our view, but not
when we reach them; we begin to see beyond.</p>

<br />

<p>... We look at things not only from other sides, but with
other eyes, and care not to find them alike.</p>

<br />

<p>Diversity is so ample, that all tones of voice, all modes of
walking, coughing, blowing the nose, sneering. We distinguish
different kinds of vine by their fruit, and name them the Condrieu,
the Desargues, and this stock. But is this all? Has a vine ever
produced two bunches exactly alike, and has a bunch ever two
grapes alike? etc.</p>

<p>I never can judge of the same thing exactly in the same way.
I cannot judge of my work while engaged on it. I must do as
the painters, stand at a distance, but not too far. How far,
then? Guess.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Diversity.</em>&mdash;Theology is a science; but at the same time
how many sciences! Man is a whole, but if we dissect him, will
man be the head, the heart, the stomach, the veins, each vein,
each portion of a vein, the blood, each humour of the blood?</p>

<p>A town, a champaign, is from afar a town and a champaign;
but as we approach there are houses, trees, tiles, leaves, grass,
emmets, limbs of emmets, in infinite series. All this is comprised
under the word champaign.</p>

<p>We like to see the error, the passion of Cleobuline, because
she is not aware of it. She would be displeasing if she were not
deceived.</p>

<br />

<p>What a confusion of judgment is that, by which every one puts
himself above all the rest of the world, and loves his own advantage
and the duration of his happiness or his life above those of
all others.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>DIVERSION.</em></a></h3>
</div>

    <div>

<p class="noindent">Diversion.&mdash;When I have set myself now and then to consider
the various distractions of men, the toils and dangers to which
they expose themselves in the court or the camp, whence
arise so many quarrels and passions, such daring and often
such evil exploits, etc., I have discovered that all the misfortunes
of men arise from one thing only, that they are unable to
stay quietly in their own chamber. A man who has enough to
live on, if he knew how to dwell with pleasure in his own home,
would not leave it for sea-faring or to besiege a city. An office
in the army would not be bought so dearly but that it seems
insupportable not to stir from the town, and people only seek
conversation and amusing games because they cannot remain
with pleasure in their own homes.</p>

<p>But upon stricter examination, when, having found the cause
of all our ills, I have sought to discover the reason of it, I have
found one which is paramount, the natural evil of our weak and
mortal condition, so miserable that nothing can console us
when we think of it attentively.</p>

<p>Whatever condition we represent to ourselves, if we bring to
our minds all the advantages it is possible to possess, Royalty is
the finest position in the world. Yet, when we imagine a king
surrounded with all the conditions which he can desire, if he
be without diversion, and be allowed to consider and examine
what he is, this feeble happiness will never sustain him; he
will necessarily fall into a foreboding of maladies which threaten
him, of revolutions which may arise, and lastly, of death and
inevitable diseases; so that if he be without what is called
diversion he is unhappy, and more unhappy than the humblest
of his subjects who plays and diverts himself.</p>

<p>Hence it comes that play and the society of women, war,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
and offices of state, are so sought after. Not that there is in
these any real happiness, or that any imagine true bliss to
consist in the money won at play, or in the hare which is
hunted; we would not have these as gifts. We do not seek an
easy and peaceful lot which leaves us free to think of our unhappy
condition, nor the dangers of war, nor the troubles of
statecraft, but seek rather the distraction which amuses us, and
diverts our mind from these thoughts.</p>

<p>Hence it comes that men so love noise and movement, hence
it comes that a prison is so horrible a punishment, hence it
comes that the pleasure of solitude is a thing incomprehensible.
And it is the great subject of happiness in the condition of kings,
that all about them try incessantly to divert them, and to procure
for them all manner of pleasures.</p>

<p>The king is surrounded by persons who think only how to divert
the king, and to prevent his thinking of self. For he is unhappy,
king though he be, if he think of self.</p>

<p>That is all that human ingenuity can do for human happiness.
And those who philosophise on the matter, and think men unreasonable
that they pass a whole day in hunting a hare which
they would not have bought, scarce know our nature. The
hare itself would not free us from the view of death and our
miseries, but the chase of the hare does free us. Thus, when
we make it a reproach that what they seek with such eagerness
cannot satisfy them, if they answered as on mature judgment they
should do, that they sought in it only violent and impetuous occupation
to turn their thoughts from self, and that therefore
they made choice of an attractive object which charms and
ardently attracts them, they would leave their adversaries
without a reply. But they do not so answer because they do
not know themselves; they do not know they seek the chase
and not the quarry.</p>

<p>They fancy that were they to gain such and such an office
they would then rest with pleasure, and are unaware of the insatiable
nature of their desire. They believe they are honestly
seeking repose, but they are only seeking agitation.</p>

<p>They have a secret instinct prompting them to look for diversion
and occupation from without, which arises from the sense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
of their continual pain. They have another secret instinct, a
relic of the greatness of our primitive nature, teaching them that
happiness indeed consists in rest, and not in turmoil. And of
these two contrary instincts a confused project is formed within
them, concealing itself from their sight in the depths of their soul,
leading them to aim at rest through agitation, and always to
imagine that they will gain the satisfaction which as yet they
have not, if by surmounting certain difficulties which now confront
them, they may thereby open the door to rest.</p>

<p>Thus rolls all our life away. We seek repose by resistance to
obstacles, and so soon as these are surmounted, repose becomes
intolerable. For we think either on the miseries we feel or on
those we fear. And even when we seem sheltered on all sides,
weariness, of its own accord, will spring from the depths of the
heart wherein are its natural roots, and fill the soul with its
poison.</p>

<br />

<p>The counsel given to Pyrrhus to take the rest of which he was
going in search through so many labours, was full of difficulties.</p>

<br />

<p>A gentleman sincerely believes that the chase is a great, and
even a royal sport, but his whipper-in does not share his
opinion.</p>

<p><em>Dancing.</em>&mdash;We must think where to place our feet.</p>

<br />

<p>But can you say what object he has in all this? The pleasure
of boasting to-morrow among his friends that he has played
better than another. Thus others sweat in their closets to
prove to the learned world that they have solved an algebraical
problem hitherto insoluble, while many more expose themselves
to the greatest perils, in my judgment as foolishly, for the
glory of taking a town. Again, others kill themselves, by their
very application to all these studies, not indeed that they may
grow wiser, but simply to prove that they know them; these
are the most foolish of the band, because they are so wittingly,
whereas it is reasonable to suppose of the others, that were they
but aware of it, they would give over their folly.</p>

<p>A man passes his life without weariness in playing every day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
for a small stake. Give him each morning, on condition he does
not play, the money he might possibly win, and you make him
miserable. It will be said, perhaps, that he seeks the amusement
of play, and not the winnings. Make him then play for
nothing, he will not be excited over it, and will soon be wearied.
Mere diversion then is not his pursuit, a languid and passionless
amusement will weary him. He must grow warm in it, and
cheat himself by thinking that he is made happy by gaining
what he would despise if it were given him not to play; and
must frame for himself a subject of passion and excitement to
employ his desire, his wrath, his fear, as children are frightened
at a <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber Note: Original text 'face themselves'">face they themselves</ins> have daubed.</p>

<p>Whence comes it that a man who within a few months has
lost his only son, or who this morning was overwhelmed with
law suits and wrangling, now thinks of them no more? Be
not surprised; he is altogether taken up with looking out
for the boar which his hounds have been hunting so hotly
for the last six hours. He needs no more. However full of
sadness a man may be, he is happy for the time, if you can
only get him to enter into some diversion. And however
happy a man may be, he will soon become dispirited and miserable
if he be not diverted and occupied by some passion or
pursuit which hinders his being overcome by weariness. Without
diversion no joy, with diversion no sadness. And this
forms the happiness of persons in high position, that they have
a number of people to divert them, and that they have the
power to keep themselves in this state.</p>

<p>Take heed to this. What is it to be <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber Note: Original text 'superintendant'">superintendent</ins>, chancellor,
first president, but to be in a condition wherein from early morning
a vast number of persons flock in from every side, so as not to
leave them an hour in the day in which they can think of themselves?
And if they are in disgrace and dismissed to their
country houses, though they want neither wealth nor retinue
at need, they yet are miserable and desolate because no one
hinders them from thinking of themselves.</p>

<p>Thus man is so unhappy that he wearies himself without
cause of weariness by the peculiar state of his temperament, and
he is so frivolous that, being full of a thousand essential causes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
of weariness, the least thing, such as a cue and a ball to strike
with it, is enough to divert him.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Diversions.</em>&mdash;Men are charged from infancy with the care
of their honour, their fortunes, and their friends, and more, with
the care of the fortunes and honour of their friends. They are
overwhelmed with business, with the study of languages and
bodily exercises; they are given to understand that they cannot be
happy unless their health, their honour, their fortune and that of
their friends be in good condition, and that a single point wanting
will render them unhappy. Thus we give them business and
occupations which harass them incessantly from the very dawn
of day. A strange mode, you will say, of making them happy.
What more could be done to make them miserable? What could
be done? We need only release them from all these cares, for
then they would see themselves; they would think on what they
are, whence they come, and whither they go, and therefore it
is impossible to occupy and distract them too much. This is
why, after having provided them with constant business, if there
be any time to spare we urge them to employ it in diversion
and in play, so as to be always fully occupied.</p>

<br />

<p>How comes it that this man, distressed at the death of his
wife and his only son, or who has some great and embarrassing
law suit, is not at this moment sad, and that he appears
so free from all painful and distressing thoughts? We need
not be astonished, for a ball has just been served to him, and
he must return it to his opponent. His whole thoughts are
fixed on taking it as it falls from the pent-house, to win a chase;
and you cannot ask that he should think on his business, having
this other affair in hand. Here is a care worthy of occupying
this great soul, and taking away from him every other thought of
the mind. This man, born to know the Universe, to judge of all
things, to rule a State, is altogether occupied and filled with the
business of catching a hare. And if he will not abase himself
to this, and wishes always to be highly strung, he will only be
more foolish still, because he wishes to raise himself above
humanity; yet when all is said and done he is only a man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
that is to say capable of little and of much, of all and of
nothing. He is neither angel nor brute, but man.</p>

<p>One thought alone occupies us, we cannot think of two things
at once; a good thing for us from a worldly point of view, but
not as regards God.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Diversion.</em>&mdash;Death is easier to bear without the thought of
it, than is the thought of death without danger.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Diversion.</em>&mdash;Men, unable to remedy death, sorrow, and ignorance,
determine, in order to make themselves happy, not to
think on these things.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these miseries, man wishes to be happy, and
wishes for happiness only; unable to wish otherwise, he knows
not how to gain happiness. For this he must needs make himself
immortal; but unable to effect this, he sets himself to avoid
the thought of death.</p>

<br />

<p>The miseries of human life are the cause of all this; having a
perception of them men take to diversion.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Diversion.</em>&mdash;If man were happy he would be the more so
the less he was diverted, like the Saints and God.</p>

<p>Yes: but is not the power of being pleased with diversion
in itself a happiness? No; for that comes from elsewhere and
from without, so it is dependent, and therefore liable to be
troubled by a thousand accidents, which make afflictions
inevitable.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Misery.</em>&mdash;The one thing which consoles us for our miseries is
diversion, yet this itself is the greatest of our miseries. For
this it is which mainly hinders us from thinking of ourselves,
and which insensibly destroys us. Without this we should be
weary, and weariness would drive us to seek a more abiding way
out of it. But diversion beguiles us and leads us insensibly
onward to death.</p>

<br />

<p>This is all they have been able to discover to console them in
so many evils. But it is a miserable consolation, since it does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
serve for the cure of the evil, but simply for the concealment of it
for a short time, and its very concealment prevents the thought of
any true cure. Thus by a strange inversion of man's nature he
finds that the weariness which is his most sensible evil, is in
some measure his greatest good, because more than any thing
else it contributes to make him seek his true healing, and
that the diversion which he regards as his greatest good is in
fact his greatest evil, because more than <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber Note: Original text 'any thing thing else'">any thing else</ins> it prevents
his seeking the remedy for his evils. Both of these are admirable
proofs of man's misery and corruption, and at the same time
of his greatness, since man is only weary of all things, and only
seeks this multitude of occupations because he has the
idea of a lost happiness. And not finding this in himself,
he seeks it vainly in external things, without being able to content
himself, because it is neither in us, nor in the creature, but
in God alone.</p>

<p><em>Thoughts.</em>&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">In omnibus requiem quæsivi.</i></p>

<p>Were our condition truly happy we need not turn our minds
from it in order to become happy.</p>

<p>A little matter consoles us, because a little matter afflicts us.</p>

<br />

<p>Strife alone pleases us and not the victory. We like to see
beasts fighting, not the victor furious over the vanquished. We
wish only to see the victorious end, and as soon as it comes,
we are surfeited. It is the same in play, and in the search for
truth. In all disputes we like to see the clash of opinions, but
care not at all to contemplate truth when found. If we are to
see truth with pleasure, we must see it arise out of conflict.</p>

<p>So in the passions, there is pleasure in seeing the shock of
two contraries, but as soon as one gains the mastery it becomes
mere brutality. We never seek things in themselves, but only
the search for things. So on the stage, quiet scenes which raise
no emotion are worthless, so is extreme and hopeless misery, so
are brutal lust and excessive cruelty.</p>

<br />

<p>Continuous eloquence wearies.</p>

<p>Princes and kings sometimes unbend. They are not for ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
on their thrones, where they grow weary. Grandeur to be felt
must be abandoned, continuity in any thing is displeasing. Cold
is pleasant, that we may seek warmth.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Weariness.</em>&mdash;Nothing is so insupportable to man as to be
completely at rest, without passion, without business, without
diversion, without study. He then feels his nothingness, his
loneliness, his insufficiency, his dependence, his weakness, his
emptiness.</p>

<p>At once, from the depth of his soul, will arise weariness,
gloom, sadness, vexation, disappointment, despair.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Agitation.</em>&mdash;When a soldier complains of his work, or a
ploughman, etc., force them to be idle.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Diversion.</em>&mdash;Is not the royal dignity itself so truly great as to
make its possessor happy by the mere contemplation of what he
is? Must he be diverted from this thought like ordinary people?
I see well enough that a man may be made happy by diverting him
from the thought of his domestic sorrows so that he apply all his
care to excel in dancing. But will it be the same with a king,
and will he be happier if he devote himself to these idle amusements
rather than to the contemplation of his greatness? And
what more satisfactory object can he offer to his mind? Might
it not be to lessen his content that he occupy his soul in thinking
how to suit his steps to the cadence of an air, or how to throw a
bar skilfully, rather than allow it to enjoy peacefully the contemplation
of the majesty which wraps him round? Let us make
the experiment, let us leave a king all alone, without any
gratifications of sense, or any occupation for the mind, without
companions, reflecting on himself at leisure, and it will be
seen that a king without diversion is a man full of miseries.
This is therefore carefully avoided, and there are always about
the persons of kings a great number of people who watch to see
that diversion succeeds to business, and look after their every
hour of leisure to furnish them with pleasures and games, so that
no vacancy may be left in life; that is, they are surrounded with
persons who take wonderful pains that the king is never alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
and able to think of self, knowing well that he will be miserable,
king though he is, if he think of self.</p>

<p>In all this I am not speaking of Christian kings as Christians,
but simply as kings.</p>

<br />

<p>Men busy themselves in pursuing a ball or a hare, and this
is the pleasure even of kings.</p>

<br />

<p>Cæsar, as it seems to me, was too old to set about amusing
himself with the conquest of the world. Such a pastime was
good for Augustus or Alexander, who were still young men,
and these are difficult to restrain, but Cæsar should have been
more mature.</p>

<br />

<p>The weariness we experience in leaving occupations to which
we are attached. A man lives with pleasure in his home, but if
he see a woman who charms him, or if he take pleasure in play
for five or six days, he is miserable if he return to his former
mode of life. Nothing is more common than that.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Frivolity.</em>&mdash;It is plain that the frivolity of the world is so little
known, that it is a strange and surprising thing to say it is
foolish to seek for greatness, and this is great cause for wonder.</p>

<br />

<p>Whoso does not see the frivolity of the world is himself most
frivolous. And indeed all see it save young people, who are
engaged in turmoil, diversion, and the thought of the future.
But take away their diversion and you will see them consumed
with weariness; then they feel their nothingness without knowing
it. For it is indeed to be unhappy to be intolerably sad
as soon as we are reduced to the thought of self, without any
diversion.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>THE GREATNESS AND LITTLENESS<br />
<br />
OF MAN.</em></a></h3>
</div>

    <div>

<p class="noindent"><em>Greatness, Littleness</em>.&mdash;The more light we have, the more
greatness and the more baseness we discover in man.</p>

<p>Ordinary men....</p>

<p>The more cultivated....</p>

<p>Philosophers.</p>

<p>They astonish ordinary men.</p>

<p>Christians. They astonish Philosophers.</p>

<p>Who then will be surprised to see that Religion only makes
us know deeply what we already know in proportion to our
light.</p>

<br />

<p><em>For Port Royal. Greatness and Littleness.</em></p>

<p>Littleness being correlative to greatness, and greatness to
littleness, some have inferred man's littleness all the more because
they have taken his greatness as a proof of it, and others
have inferred his greatness with all the more force, because they
have inferred it from his littleness; all that the one party was
able to say for his greatness having served only as an argument
of his littleness to others, because we are low in proportion to
the height from which we have fallen, and the contrary is equally
true. So that the one party returns on the other in an endless
circle, for it is certain that in measure as men possess light the
more they discern both the greatness and the littleness of man.
In a word, man knows he is little. He is then little because he
is so; but he is truly great because he knows it.</p>

<br />

<p>Man knows not in what rank to place himself. He has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
evidently gone astray and fallen from his true place, unable to
find it again. Disquieted and unsuccessful he seeks it everywhere
in impenetrable darkness.</p>

<br />

<p>Though we see all the miseries which close upon us and
take us by the throat, we have an irrepressible instinct which
raises us.</p>

<br />

<p><em>The greatness of Man.</em>&mdash;We have so great an idea of the human
soul that we cannot bear to be despised, or to lie under the disesteem
of any soul, and all the happiness of men consists in that
esteem.</p>

<br />

<p>The search after glory is the greatest vileness of man.
Yet it is also the greatest mark of his excellence, for whatever
riches he may have on earth, whatever health and advantage, he
is not satisfied if he have not the esteem of men. He rates
human reason so highly that whatever privileges he may have
on earth, he is not content unless he stand well in the judgment
of men. This is the finest position in the world, nothing can
turn him from this desire, which is the most indelible quality of
the human heart.</p>

<p>And those who most despise men, and place them on the
level of the brutes, still wish to be admired and believed
by men, and are in contradiction with themselves through their
own feelings; their nature, which is stronger than all else,
convincing them of the greatness of man more powerfully than
reason convinces them of their vileness.</p>

<br />

<p>The vileness of man in that he submits himself to the brutes,
and even worships them.</p>

<br />

<p>Instinct and reason, marks of two natures.</p>

<br />

<p>Description of man. Dependence, desire of independence,
bodily needs.</p>

<br />

<p>Contradiction. To despise existence, to die for nothing, to
hate our existence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<br />

<p>Man is neither angel nor brute, and the misfortune is that
whoever would play the angel plays the brute.</p>

<br />

<p>If man is not made for God, why is he happy only in God?</p>

<p>If man is made for God, why is he so contrary to God?</p>

<br />

<p>Contraries. Man is naturally credulous and incredulous,
timid and rash.</p>

<br />

<p><em>A corrupt nature.</em>&mdash;Man does not act by reason, which
constitutes his essence.</p>

<br />

<p>The nature of man is his whole nature, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">omne animal</i>.</p>

<p>There is nothing we cannot make natural, nothing natural we
cannot lose.</p>

<br />

<p>The true nature being lost, all becomes natural. As the true
good being lost, all becomes truly good.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Misery.</em>&mdash;Solomon and Job best knew, and have best spoken
of human misery; the former the most fortunate, the latter the
most unfortunate of men; the one knowing by experience the
vanity of pleasure, the other the reality of evil.</p>

<br />

<p>It is dangerous to prove to man too plainly how nearly he is
on a level with the brutes without showing him his greatness;
it is also dangerous to show him his greatness too clearly
apart from his vileness. It is still more dangerous to leave him
in ignorance of both. But it is of great advantage to show him
both.</p>

<br />

<p>How comes it that we have so much patience with those who
are maimed in body, and so little with those who are defective
in mind? Because a cripple recognises that we have the true
use of our legs, but the fool maintains that we are they whose
understanding halts; were it not so we should feel pity and not
anger.</p>

<p>Epictetus puts it yet more strongly: "How comes it that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
are not angry if a man says we have an headache, but are angry
if told we use a weak argument or make a wrong choice?" The
reason of this is that we are quite certain we have no headache,
or are not lame, but we are not equally sure that our judgment is
correct. So having no assurance but that we see with our
whole powers of sight, we are startled and confounded when
another with equal powers sees the exact opposite, especially
when a thousand others laugh at our decision; for then we must
prefer our light to that of so many others, a daring and difficult
matter. There is never this contradiction in feeling as to a
cripple.</p>

<p>Man is so framed that by dint of telling him he is a fool he
believes it, and by dint of telling it to himself he makes himself
believe it. For man holds a secret communing with himself,
which it behoves him well to regulate: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Corrumpunt mores bonos
colloquia prava</i>. We must keep silent as much as possible, and
converse with ourselves only of God, whom we know to be true,
and thus we persuade ourselves of truth.</p>

<br />

<p>I will not suffer him to rest on himself, nor on another, so that
being without a resting place or repose....</p>

<br />

<p>If he exalt himself I humble him, if he humble himself I
exalt him, and ever contradict him, till he comprehend that
he is an incomprehensible monster.</p>

<br />

<p>The greatness of man consists in thought.</p>

<br />

<p><em>A thinking reed.</em>&mdash;Not from space must I seek my dignity,
but from the ruling of my thought. I should have no more if
I possessed whole worlds. By space the Universe encompasses
and swallows me as an atom, by thought I encompass it.</p>

<br />

<p>Man is but a reed, weakest in nature, but a reed which
thinks. It needs not that the whole Universe should arm to
crush him. A vapour, a drop of water is enough to kill him.
But were the Universe to crush him, man would still be more
noble than that which has slain him, because he knows that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
dies, and that the Universe has the better of him. The Universe
knows nothing of this.</p>

<br />

<p>All our dignity therefore consists in thought. By this must
we raise ourselves, not by space or duration which we cannot
fill. Then let us make it our study to think well, for this is the
starting-point of morals.</p>

<br />

<p>The greatness of man is great in that he knows he is miserable.
A tree does not know that it is miserable.</p>

<p>It is therefore little to know ourselves little, and it is great to
know ourselves little.</p>

<p>Thus his very infirmities proves man's greatness. They are
the infirmities of a great lord, of a discrowned king.</p>

<br />

<p>The greatness of man is so evident that it is even proved by
his littleness. For what in animals is nature we call in man littleness,
whereby we recognise that his nature being now like that
of animals he is fallen from a better nature which once was his.</p>

<p>For what man ever was unhappy at not being a king, save a discrowned
king? Was Paulus Emilius unhappy at being no longer
consul? On the contrary, all men thought him happy in having
filled that office, because it was involved in it that it should be
but temporary. But Perseus was thought so unhappy in being
no longer king, because the condition of royalty involved his
being always king, that it was thought strange he could bear
to live. No man thinks himself unhappy in having but one
mouth, but any man is unhappy if he have but one eye. No man
was ever grieved at not having three eyes, but any man is
inconsolable if he have none.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Perseus, King of Macedon.</em>&mdash;Paulus Emilius reproached
Perseus for not killing himself.</p>

<br />

<p>There is no misery apart from sensation. A ruined house is
not miserable. Man only is miserable. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ego vir videns.</i></p>

<br />

<p>It is then thought which makes man's being, and without this we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
cannot conceive him. What is it in us which feels pleasure?
The hand? The arm? The flesh? The blood? We see that it
roust be something immaterial.</p>

<br />

<p>I can easily conceive a man without hands, feet, head, for it
is only experience which teaches us that the head is more
necessary than the feet. But I cannot conceive a man without
thought; he would be a stone or a brute.</p>

<br />

<p>Man is evidently made for thought, this is his whole dignity
and his whole merit; his whole duty is to think as he ought.
Now the order of thought is to begin with self, and with its
author and its end.</p>

<p>Now of what thinks the world? Never of these things, but of
dancing, playing the lute, singing, making verses, tilting at
the ring, etc., of fighting, making ourselves kings, without
thinking what it is to be a king, or what to be a man.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Thought.</em>&mdash;The whole dignity of man lies in thought But
what is this thought? how foolish it is!</p>

<br />

<p>Thought is then in its nature admirable and incomparable.
It must have strange defects to be despicable, but it has these,
and so nothing is more ridiculous.</p>

<p>How great it is in essence, how vile in defects!</p>

<br />

<p><em>Contraries.</em> <em>After having shown the vileness and the greatness
of man.</em>&mdash;Let man now estimate his value. Let him love
himself, because he has a nature capable of good, but let him not
therefore love the vileness which exists in that nature. Let
him despise himself, because this capacity is void, but let him
not therefore despise his natural capacity. Let him hate himself,
let him love himself: he has in himself the power of knowing
the truth and being happy, and yet has found no truth
either permanent or satisfactory.</p>

<p>I would then lead man to the desire of finding it; to be free
from passions and ready to follow it where he may find it,
knowing how his knowledge is obscured by the passions. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
would that he should hate in himself the desires which bias his
judgment, that they may neither blind him in making his choice,
nor obstruct him when he has chosen.</p>

<br />

<p>I blame equally those who take on themselves to praise
man, those who take on themselves to blame him, and those who
merely amuse themselves; I can approve those only who seek
with tears.</p>

<br />

<p>The stoics say, "Retire within yourselves, there will you find
your rest;" which is not true. Others say, "Go out of yourselves,
seek your happiness in diversion;" nor is that true, for sickness
may come.</p>

<p>Happiness is neither without us nor within us; it is in God,
both without us and within us.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>OF THE DECEPTIVE POWERS OF<br /><br />
THE IMAGINATION</em>.</a></h3>
</div>

    <div>

<p class="noindent"><em>Of the deceptive powers</em>.&mdash;Man is only a subject full of natural
error, which is indelible without grace. Nothing shows him the
truth, everything deceives him. These two principles of truth,
reason and the senses, in addition to the fact that they are both
wanting in sincerity, reciprocally deceive each other. The senses
trick the reason by false appearances, and gain from reason in
their turn the same deception with which they deceive; reason
avenges herself. The passions of the soul trouble the senses,
and make on them false impressions. They lie and deceive,
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber Note: Original text 'outvieing'">outvying</ins> one another.</p>

<p>But beyond those errors which come by accident, and by a
lack of intelligence, with these heterogeneous faculties....
<em>To begin thus the chapter on the deceptive powers</em>.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Imagination.</em>&mdash;This is that deceitful part of man, the mistress
of error and falsity, the more knavish that she is not always
so, for she would be an infallible rule of truth, if she were an infallible
rule of lying. But being for the most part false, she
gives no mark of her character, stamping the true and the false
with the same die.</p>

<p>I speak not of fools, but of the wisest men, and it is among
them that imagination has the great gift of persuasion. Reason
protests in vain, for she can make no true estimate.</p>

<p>This proud potentate, who loves to rule and domineer over her
enemy, reason, has established in man a second nature in order
to show her wide-spread influence. She makes men happy and
miserable, sound and sick, rich and poor; she obliges reason to
believe, doubt and deny; she dulls the senses, or sharpens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
them; she has her fools and wise; and nothing vexes us more
than to see that she fills her votaries with a satisfaction far more
full and entire than does reason. Those whose imagination is
active feel greater complacency than the truly wise can reasonably
allow themselves to feel. They look down on other men as from
the height of empire, they argue with assurance and confidence,
others with diffidence and fear, and this gaiety of countenance
often gives the former an advantage in the minds of their
hearers; such favour do the imaginary wise find from judges like-minded.
Imagination cannot make fools wise, but it makes them
content, and so triumphs over reason, which can only make its
friends miserable; the one covers them with glory, the other
with shame.</p>

<p>What but this faculty of imagination dispenses reputation,
assigns respect and veneration to persons, works, laws, and the
great? How valueless are all the treasures of earth without her
consent!</p>

<p>You would say that this magistrate whose reverend age commands
the respect of a whole people is swayed by pure and lofty
reason, that he judges all causes according to their true nature,
unmoved by those mere accidents which only affect the imagination
of the weak. See him go to sermon with devout zeal,
strengthening his firm and impartial reason by the ardour of his
divine love. He is ready to listen with exemplary respect. The
preacher appears; but if nature have given him a hoarse voice or
a comic face, if his barber have shaven him ill, or if his clothes
be splashed more than is wont, then however great the truths he
announces, I wager that our statesman lose his gravity.</p>

<p>Set the greatest philosopher in the world on a plank really
wider than he needs, but hanging over a precipice, and though
reason convince him of his security, imagination will prevail.
Many will scarce bear the thought without a cold sweat.</p>

<p>I will not name all its effects. Every one knows that the sight
of cats, and rats, or the crushing of a coal, etc., may quite unhinge
the reason. The tone of voice will affect the wisest and change
the whole force of a speech or a poem.</p>

<p>Love or hate will change the aspect of justice, and an
advocate retained with a large fee has an increased confidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
in the right of the cause he pleads, while the assurance of his
demeanour commends it to the judges, duped in their turn by
appearances. How ridiculous is reason, swayed by a breath
in every direction!</p>

<p>I should have to enumerate almost every action of men who
seldom stagger but under her shocks. For reason has been forced
to yield, and the wisest reason accepts as her own those principles
which the imagination of men has everywhere casually
introduced.</p>

<p>Our magistrates are well aware of this mystery. Their scarlet
robes, the ermine in which they wrap themselves like furred cats,
the halls in which they administer justice, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fleurs-de-lis</i>, and
all their august apparatus are most necessary; if the doctors had
not their cassocks and their mules, if the lawyers had not their
square caps, and their robes four times too wide, they would
never have duped the world, which cannot resist so authoritative
an appearance. Soldiers alone are not disguised after this
fashion, because indeed their part is the more essential, they
establish themselves by force, the others by fraud.</p>

<p>So our kings seek out no disguises. They do not mask themselves
in strange garments to appear such, but they are accompanied
by guards and halberdiers. Those armed puppets who
have hands and power for them alone, those trumpets and drums
which go before them, and those legions round about them,
make the firmest tremble. They have not dress only, but power;
we need an highly refined reason to regard as an ordinary man
the Grand Turk, in his superb seraglio, surrounded with forty
thousand janissaries.</p>

<p>We cannot even see an advocate in his long robe and with
his cap on his head, without an enhanced opinion of his ability.</p>

<p>If magistrates had true justice, and if doctors had the true
art of healing, they would have no need of square caps, the
majesty of these sciences were of itself venerable enough. But
having only imaginary knowledge, they must take these instruments,
idle, but striking to the imagination with which they have
to deal, and by that in fact they gain respect.</p>

<p>Imagination is the disposer of all things, it creates beauty, justice
and happiness, and these are the world's all. I should much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
like to see an Italian work, of which I know the title only, but
such a title is worth many books: <cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">Della opinione Regina del
mondo</cite>. I accept the book without knowing it, save the evil in it,
if there be any.</p>

<p>These are for the most part the effects of that deceptive
faculty, which seems to have been given us expressly to lead
us into necessary error. Of error however we have many other
sources.</p>

<p>Not only are old impressions capable of deceiving us, the
charms of novelty have the same power. Hence arise all the
disputes of men, who charge each other either with following
the false impressions of childhood or of running rashly
after new. Who rightly keeps a middle way? Let him appear
and make good his pretensions. There is no principle,
however natural to us even from childhood, which may not
be made to pass for a false impression either of education or
of sense.</p>

<p>"Because," say some, "you have believed from childhood that
a box was empty when you saw nothing in it, you have therefore
believed the possibility of a vacuum. This is an illusion of your
senses, strengthened by custom, which science must correct."
"Because," say others, "you were taught at school that there
is no such thing as a vacuum, your common sense, which clearly
comprehended the matter before, is corrupted, and you must
correct this false impression by returning to your primitive
nature." Which has deceived you, your senses or your education?</p>

<p>Diseases are another source of error. They impair our
judgment and our senses, and if the more violent produce a
sensible change, I do not doubt that slighter ailments produce
each its proportionate impression.</p>

<p>Our own interest is again a wonderful instrument for putting out
our eyes in a pleasant way. The man of greatest probity can
not be judge in his own cause; I know some who that they
may not fall into this self love are, out of opposition, thoroughly
unjust. The certain way of ruining a just cause has been to
get it recommended to these men by their near relatives.</p>

<p>Justice and truth are two such subtle points, that our instruments
are too blunt to touch them accurately. If they attain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the point they cover it so completely that they rest more often
on the wrong than the right.</p>

<br />

<p>There is internecine war in man between the reason and the
passions.</p>

<p>If he had only reason without passions....</p>

<p>If he had only passions without reason....</p>

<p>But having both he must have continual strife, since he cannot
be at peace with one unless he be at war with the other. Hence
he is always divided against and contrary to himself.</p>

<br />

<p>The habit of seeing kings accompanied by guards, drums,
officers and all those things which mechanically incline man
to respect and terror, causes their countenance, when now and
then seen alone, and without these accompaniments, to impress
respect and terror on their subjects, because our thought cannot
separate their personality from those surroundings with which
it is ordinarily joined. And the world which does not know that
the effect arises from habit, believes that it arises from natural
force, and hence come such expressions as: "The character of
Divinity is imprinted on his countenance," etc.</p>

<br />

<p>The power of kings is based both on the reason and the folly
of the people, and mainly on their folly. The greatest and most
important matter in the world has weakness for its foundation,
and this foundation is admirably sure, for there is nothing more
sure than this, that the people will be weak. What is founded
on sound reason is very ill founded, as the value of wisdom.</p>

<br />

<p>The chancellor is grave, and clothed with ornaments, for his
position is unreal. Not so the king, he has power and nothing
to do with imagination. Judges, doctors, etc., depend solely
on imagination.</p>

<br />

<p>Empire founded on opinion and imagination lasts some time,
the rule is gentle and willingly accepted; that founded on power
lasts for ever. Thus opinion is, as it were, queen of the world,
but power is its tyrant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Power is the queen of the world, not opinion, but opinion makes
use of power.</p>

<p>Power creates opinion. Gentleness is beautiful, as we think.
Why? Because he who goes to extremes will be alone, and I
will make a stronger cabal of people who will say it is inexpedient.</p>

<br />

<p>The cords attached by the respect of man for man, are, for the
most part, cords of necessity, for there must be different degrees,
all men wishing to rule, but not all being able to do so, though
some are able.</p>

<p>Let us suppose then we see men beginning to form a society.
They will no doubt fight till the stronger party gets the better
of the weaker, and a dominant party is constituted. But so
soon as this is once settled, the masters not wishing that
the strife should continue, declare that the power in their hands
shall be transmitted as they please, some placing it in the choice
of the people, others in the succession of birth, etc.</p>

<p>And here imagination begins to play her part. Till now power
has constrained facts, now power is upheld by imagination in
a certain party, in France that of the nobles, in Switzerland that
of the burgesses, etc.</p>

<p>The cords therefore which bind the respect of men to any given
man are the cords of imagination.</p>

<br />

<p>Our imagination so enlarges the present by dint of continually
reflecting on it, and so contracts eternity, by never reflecting on
it, that we make a nothing of eternity and an eternity of nothing;
and all this has such living roots in us, that all our reason cannot
suppress them, and that....</p>

<br />

<p>The imagination enlarges little objects so as to fill our soul
with its fantastic estimate, and by a rash insolence belittles the
great to its own measure, as when it speaks of God.</p>

<br />

<p>Things which have the greatest hold on us, as the concealing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
our small possessions, are often a mere nothing. It is a nothing
which our imagination magnifies into a mountain, another turn
of imagination would make us discover its nothingness without
difficulty.</p>

<br />

<p>Two faces which resemble each other, neither of which alone
causes our laughter, make us laugh, when together, by their
resemblance.</p>

<br />

<p>Children who are frightened at the face they have daubed are
mere children, but how shall one who is so weak when a child
grow truly strong as he grows old? We only change our fancies.</p>

<br />

<p>All that is brought to perfection by progress perishes also by
progress. All that has been weak can never be absolutely
strong. It is in vain to say, "He has grown, he has changed."
He is also the same.</p>

<br />

<p>My fancy makes me hate a man who breathes hard when he is
eating. Fancy has great weight. Will you profit by yielding
to this weight because it is natural? No; but by resisting it.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Prejudice leading into error.</em>&mdash;It is a deplorable thing to see
all men deliberating on means alone, and not on the end. Every
man thinks how he may acquit himself in his condition, but as
for the choice of condition or of country, chance gives them
to us.</p>

<p>It is a pitiable thing, to see so many Turks, heretics and
infidels, follow the way of their fathers for the simple reason
that each has been told it is the best. And that fixes for each
man his condition, locksmith, soldier, etc.</p>

<p>Therefore savages would care nothing for Provence.</p>

<br />

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ferox gens, nullam esse vitam sine armis rati.</i> They love
death rather than peace, other men love death rather than war.</p>

<p>Every opinion may be held in preference to life, of which the
love seems so strong and so natural.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Thoughts.</em>&mdash;All is one, all is diverse. How many natures in
that of man, how many vocations! And by what a chance does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
each man take ordinarily what he has heard praised. A well
turned heel.</p>

<br />

<p><em>The heel of a slipper.</em>&mdash;How well this is turned, here is a clever
workman, how brave is this soldier! Such is the source of our
inclinations and of the choice of conditions. How much this
man drinks, how little that man! That is what makes men
sober or drunken, soldiers, cowards, etc.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Glory.</em>&mdash;Admiration spoils everything from infancy. How
well said, how well done, how clever he is! etc.</p>

<p>The children of Port Royal, who are not urged with this spur
of envy and glory, become careless.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Glory.</em>&mdash;The brutes have no admiration for each other. A horse
does not admire his companion. Not but that they have their
rivalries in a race, but that entails no consequences, for once in
the stable the heaviest and most ill-formed does not yield his
oats to another, as men would expect from others in their own
case. Their virtue is satisfied with itself.</p>

<br />

<p>First degree: to be blamed for doing evil, and praised for
doing good. Second degree: to be neither praised nor blamed.</p>

<br />

<p>Brave deeds are most estimable when hidden. When I see
some of these in history they please me much. But after all
they have not been wholly hidden, since they have become known.
And though all has been done to hide them that could be done,
the little whereby they have appeared has spoiled all, for what
was finest in them was the desire to hide them.</p>

<br />

<p>We are not content with the life we have in ourselves and in
our own being, we wish to live an imaginary life in the idea of
others, and to this end we strive to make a show. We
labour incessantly to embellish and preserve this imaginary
being, and we neglect the true. And if we have either calmness,
generosity, or fidelity, we hasten to let it be known, that we
may attach these virtues to that imaginary being; we would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
even part with them for this end, and gladly become cowards
for the reputation of valour. It is a great mark of the nothingness
of our own being that we are not satisfied with the one
without the other, and that we often renounce one for the other.
For he would be infamous who would not die to preserve his
honour.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Vocations.</em>&mdash;The sweetness of glory is so great that join it to
what we will, even to death, we love it.</p>

<br />

<p>Evil is easy, and its forms are infinite; good is almost unique.
But a certain kind of evil is as difficult to find as what is called
good; and often on this account this particular kind of evil gets
passed off as good. There is even needed an extraordinary
greatness of soul to attain to it as well as to good.</p>

<br />

<p>We are so presumptuous that we would fain be known by the
whole world, even by those who shall come after, when we are no
more. And we are such triflers that the esteem of five or six
persons about us diverts and contents us.</p>

<br />

<p>Vanity is so anchored in the heart of man that a soldier, a
camp-follower, a cook, a porter makes his boasts, and is for
having his admirers; even philosophers wish for them. Those
who write against it, yet desire the glory of having written well,
those who read, desire the glory of having read; I who write this
have, may be, this desire, and perhaps those who will read it....</p>

<br />

<p>In towns through which we pass we care not whether men
esteem us, but we do care if we have to live there any time.
How long is needed? A time in proportion to our vain and
fleeting life.</p>

<br />

<p>The condition of man; inconstancy, weariness, unrest.</p>

<br />

<p>Whoever will know fully the vanity of man has but to consider
the causes and the effects of love. The cause is an unknown
quantity, and the effects are terrible. This unknown quantity, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
small a matter that we cannot recognise it, moves a whole
country, princes, armies, and all the world.</p>

<p>Cleopatra's nose: had it been shorter, the face of the world
had been changed.</p>

<br />

<p>Nothing better shows the frivolity of men than to consider
what are the causes and what the effects of love, for all the
universe is changed by them. Cleopatra's nose.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Frivolity.</em>&mdash;The cause and the effects of love. Cleopatra.</p>

<br />

<p>Pride is a counterpoise, and turns the scale against all woes.
Here is a strange monster, a very visible aberration. Behold him
fallen from his place, and anxiously seeking it. That is what
all men do. Let us see who has found it.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Contradiction.</em>&mdash;Pride is a counterpoise to all miseries. Man
either conceals them, or if he display them, glories in the
knowledge of them.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Of the desire of being esteemed by those with whom we are.</em>&mdash;Pride
has a natural possession of us in the midst of our miseries,
errors, etc. We can even lose our life with joy, if men will but
talk of it.</p>

<p>Vanity, play, hunting, visiting, false pretences, a lasting name.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Pride.</em>&mdash;Curiosity is mere frivolity. For the most part we want
to know only for the sake of talking. People would not make
voyages if they were never to speak of them, for the sole pleasure
of seeing, without hope of ever communicating their impressions.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>OF JUSTICE, CUSTOMS, AND PREJUDICES.</em></a></h3>
</div>

    <div>

<p class="noindent">On what shall man found the economy of the world which he
would fain govern? If on the caprice of each man, all is
confusion. If on justice, man is ignorant of it.</p>

<p>Certainly had he known it, he would not have established the
maxim, most general of all current among men, that every one
must conform to the manners of his own country; the splendour
of true equity would have brought all nations into subjection,
and legislators would not have taken as their model the
fancies and caprice of Persians and Germans instead of
stable justice. We should have seen it established in all the
States of the world, in all times, whereas now we see neither
justice nor injustice which does not change its quality upon
changing its climate. Three degrees of latitude reverse all
jurisprudence, a meridian decides what is truth, fundamental
laws change after a few years of possession, right has its epochs,
the entrance of Saturn into the Lion marks for us the origin of
such and such a crime. That is droll justice which is bounded by
a stream! Truth on this side of the Pyrenees, error on that.</p>

<p>It is admitted that justice is not in these customs, but that it
resides in natural laws common to every country. This would
no doubt be maintained with obstinacy if the rash chance which
has disseminated human laws had lighted upon even one that is
universal, but the singularity of the matter is that owing to the
vagaries of human caprice there is not one.</p>

<p>Theft, incest, infanticide, parricide, all have found a place among
virtuous actions. Can there be any thing more absurd than that
a man should have the right to kill me because he lives across
the water, and because his prince has a quarrel with mine,
although I have none with him? There are no doubt natural
laws, but fair reason once corrupted has corrupted all. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nihil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
amplius nostrum est; quod nostrum dicimus, artis est. Ex
senatus consultis, et plebiscitis crimina exercentur. Ut olim vitiis,
sic nunc legibus laboramus</i>.</p>

<p>From this confusion it results that one declares the essence
of justice to be the authority of the legislator, another, the convenience
of the sovereign, another, existing custom, and this
is the most sure; nothing which follows reason alone is just in
itself, all shifts and changes with time; custom creates equity,
by the simple reason that this is received. It is the mystical
foundation of its authority, whoever carries it back to first
principles annihilates it. Nothing is so faulty as those laws
which correct faults. Whoever obeys them because they are
just, obeys an imaginary justice, not law in its essence; it is
altogether self-contained, it is law and nothing more. Whoever
will examine its motive will find it so feeble and so slight
that if he be not used to contemplate the marvels of human imagination,
he will wonder that a single century has gained for it
so much pomp and reverence. It is the art of disturbance and
of revolution to shake established customs, sounding them to
their source, to mark their want of authority and justice. We
must, it is said, return to the primitive and fundamental laws of
the State, abolished by unjust custom. It is a game wherein we
are sure to lose all; in this balance nothing would be true, yet
the people easily lends an ear to such talk as this. They shake
off the yoke as soon as they recognise it, and the great profit
by its ruin, and by the ruin of those who have too curiously
examined recognised customs. This is why the wisest of law
givers said that it was often necessary to cheat men for their
good, and another, a good politician, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quum veritatem qua liberetur
ignoret, expedit quod fallatur</i>. We ought not to feel the
truth that law is but usurpation; it was once introduced without
reason, and has become reasonable; it is necessary to cause
it to be regarded as eternal and authoritative, and to conceal
the beginning if we do not wish it should soon come to an end.</p>

<br />

<p>I have passed much of my life believing that justice existed,
and in this I did not deceive myself, for there is justice according
as God has willed to reveal it to us. But I did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
take it so, and in that I deceived myself, for I believed that
our justice was essentially just, and that I had that whereby I
was able to know and judge of it. But I so often find that my
right judgment was at fault, that at last I have begun to distrust
myself, and then others. I saw in all countries that men change,
and thus after many changes of judgment concerning true
justice, I recognised that our nature was a continual change,
and I have not changed since; were I to change I should
but strengthen my opinion. The sceptic Archesilas became a
dogmatist.</p>

<br />

<p>The most unreasonable things in the world become most
reasonable, because of the unruly lives of men. What is less
reasonable than to choose the eldest son of a queen to guide
a state? for we do not choose as steersman of a ship that one of
the passengers who is of the best family. Such a law would be
ridiculous and unjust; but since they are so themselves, and ever
will be, it becomes reasonable and just. For would they choose
the most virtuous and able, we at once fall to blows, since
each asserts that he is the most virtuous and able. Let us then
affix this quality to something which cannot be disputed. This
man is the king's eldest son. That is clear, and there is no
dispute. Reason can do no better, for civil war is the worst
of evils.</p>

<br />

<p>Men of unruly lives assert that they alone follow nature,
while those who are orderly stray from her paths; as passengers
in a ship think that those move who stand upon the shore. Both
sides say the same thing. There must be a fixed point to enable
us to judge. The harbour decides the question for those
who are in the vessel, but where can we find the harbour in
morals?</p>

<br />

<p>When all moves equally, nothing seems to move, as in a ship.
When all tend to vice, none appears to do so. Whoever stops
draws attention to the onward movement of others, as does a
fixed point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>Justice is what is established, and thus all our established laws
are necessarily held to be just without being examined, because
they are established.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Justice.</em>&mdash;As fashion makes what is agreeable, so it makes
what is just.</p>

<br />

<p>Our natural principles are but principles of custom. In children
natural principles are those which they have received from the
habits of their fathers, as hunting in animals.</p>

<p>A different custom will produce different natural principles.
This experience testifies, and if there are some natural principles
ineradicable by custom, so are there some customs opposed to
nature ineradicable by nature, or by a second custom. This
depends on constitution.</p>

<br />

<p>Fathers fear that the natural love of their children may be effaced.
Now what sort of thing is that nature which is liable to be effaced.
Custom is a second nature which destroys the former. But what
is nature, for is not custom natural? I am greatly afraid that nature
itself may be only our first custom, as custom is second nature.</p>

<br />

<p>Montaigne was wrong: custom should only be followed because
it is custom, and not because it is reasonable or just; but most men
follow it for the simple reason that they think it just. Otherwise
they would not follow it though it were the custom, for our only
desire is to be subjected to reason or to justice. Without this,
custom would pass for tyranny, but the empire of reason and
justice is no more tyrannical than that of choice. These are
principles natural to man.</p>

<p>It is then good to obey laws and customs because they are
laws, but we ought to know that there is neither truth nor justice
to introduce into them, that we know nothing about these, and
can therefore only follow what is recognised, and thus we should
never transgress them. But most men cannot receive this doctrine,
and since they believe that truth can be found, and that it
resides in law and custom, they believe these laws, and take their
antiquity as a proof of their truth, and not merely of their authority
apart from truth. Thus they obey the laws, but are liable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
to revolt when these are shown to be of no value; and this may
be proved of all of them, looked at from a certain point of view.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Injustice.</em>&mdash;The authority of the judge is not given him for
his sake, but for that of the judged. It is dangerous to say this
to the people, but the people have too much faith in you; that
will not harm them, and may serve you. You must then say
it openly. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pasce oves meas</i>, not <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tuas</i>. You owe me pasturage.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Injustice.</em>&mdash;It is dangerous to say to the people that the laws
are not just, for men obey them only because they think them
just. Therefore it is necessary to say at the same time that they
must be obeyed because they are laws, as superiors must be
obeyed, not because they are just, but because they are superiors.
All sedition is averted, if this principle be established and it be
understood what is rightly the definition of justice.</p>

<br />

<p>If God gave us masters direct from himself, how heartily
ought we to obey them! Circumstances and necessity are
infallible masters.</p>

<br />

<p>Custom is our nature. Whoever is accustomed to the faith
believes in it, can no longer even fear hell, and believes in
nothing else. Whoever accustoms himself to believe that the
king is terrible ... etc. Who doubts then that our soul, being
accustomed to see number, space, and motion, believes that and
nothing else?</p>

<br />

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Veri juris</i>; we have it no longer; had we it, we should not
take the manners of our country as our rule of justice.</p>

<p>Here, not finding justice, we fall back on force, etc.</p>

<br />

<p>It is a ridiculous thing to consider that there are people in
the world who, having renounced all the laws of God and
nature, have yet made laws for themselves which they exactly
obey, as, for instance, the soldiers of Mahomet, thieves, heretics,
etc., and thus logicians....</p>

<p>It seems as though their licence must be without limit or barrier,
since they have broken down so many that are just and holy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<br />

<p><em>Weakness.</em>&mdash;The whole employment of men is to gain wealth;
yet they have no title to show that they justly possess it but
human caprice, nor have they power to hold it securely. It is
the same with knowledge, of which disease deprives us. We
are incapable both of truth and of goodness.</p>

<br />

<p>The Swiss are offended if they are called noble, and bring
proof of their plebeian race that they may be judged worthy of
office.</p>

<br />

<p>When the question is of judging whether we ought to make
war and kill so many men, condemning so many Spaniards to
death, there is only one man who is the judge, and he an
interested party; there ought to be a third, and he disinterested.</p>

<br />

<p>"Why do you kill me?&mdash;What! Do not you live on the other
side of the stream, my friend? If you lived on this side I should
be an assassin, and it were unjust to kill you in this fashion, but
since you live on the other side, I am a brave soldier, and it is
just."</p>

<br />

<p><em>Justice, Power.</em>&mdash;It is just that what is just should be obeyed,
it is of necessity that what is strongest should be obeyed.</p>

<p>Justice without power is unavailing, power without justice is
tyrannical. Justice without power is gainsaid, because the wicked
always exist, power without justice is condemned. We must
therefore combine justice and power, making what is just strong,
and what is strong just.</p>

<p>Justice is subject to dispute, power is easily recognised and
cannot be disputed. Thus we cannot give power to justice,
because power has arraigned justice, saying that justice is unjust,
and she herself truly just; so since we are unable to bring
about that what is just should be strong, we have made the
strong just.</p>

<br />

<p>The sole universal rules are the laws of the country in ordinary
affairs, and the law of the majority in others. And this
comes from the power which is in them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus it comes that kings, whose power is of another kind, do
not follow the majority of their ministers.</p>

<p>No doubt equality of goods is just, but since they are unable
to bring about that power should obey justice, people have
judged it right to obey power; not being able to add power to
justice they have justified power, so that justice and power
should coalesce, and peace, the sovereign good, result.</p>

<br />

<p>Do we follow the majority because they have more reason?
No; but because they have more power.</p>

<p>Do we follow ancient laws and opinions because they are
more sound? No; but because they stand alone and take from
us the root of diversity.</p>

<br />

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Summum jus, summa injuria.</i></p>

<p>The way of the majority is the best way, because it is plain,
and has power to make itself obeyed; yet it is the opinion of the
least able.</p>

<p>If men could have done so, they would have placed power in
the hands of justice, since we cannot deal with power as we
please, because it is a tangible quality, while justice is a spiritual
quality of which we dispose as we please, they have placed
justice in the hands of power, and thus that is called just which
we are forced to obey.</p>

<p>Thence arises the right of the sword, for the sword gives a
true right.</p>

<p>Otherwise we should see violence on one side and justice on
the other. The end of the twelfth <em>Provincial</em>.</p>

<p>Thence the injustice of the Fronde, which raises its so-called
justice against power.</p>

<p>It is not the same in the Church, for there is true justice and
no violence.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Injustice.</em>&mdash;That presumption should be joined to insignificance
is extreme injustice.</p>

<br />

<p>Tyranny consists in the desire of universal rule outside its
sphere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>There are different societies, in which are the strong, the fair,
the judicious, the devout, in which each man rules at home, not
elsewhere. Sometimes they meet, and the strong and the fair
contend for the mastery, foolishly, for their mastery is each in a
different kind. They do not agree, and their fault is that each
aims at universal dominion. None can obtain this, not even
power, which is of no avail in the realm of the wise; she is
only mistress of our external actions.</p>

<p><em>Tyranny.</em>&mdash;Thus the following expressions are false and
tyrannical: "I am beautiful, therefore I should be feared; I
am strong, therefore I should be loved. I am...."</p>

<p>Tyranny is the wishing to have in one way what can only be
had in another. Divers duties are owing to divers merits, the
duty of love to the pleasant, of fear to the strong, of belief to the
wise.</p>

<p>These duties should be paid, it is unjust to refuse them,
unjust also to require others. In the same way it is false and
tyrannous to say, "He is not strong, therefore I will not esteem
him; he is not clever, therefore I will not fear him."</p>

<br />

<p>It is necessary that men should be unequal. True; but that
being granted, the door is open, not only to the greatest domination,
but to the greatest tyranny.</p>

<p>It is necessary to relax the mind a little, but that opens the
door to extreme dissipation.</p>

<p>We must mark the limits.&mdash;There are no fixed boundaries in
these matters, law wishes to impose them, but the mind will not
bear them.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Mine, Thine.</em>&mdash;"This is my dog," say poor children, "that is
my place in the sunshine." Here is the beginning and the image
of the usurpation of the whole earth.</p>

<br />

<p>Good birth is a great advantage, for it gives a man a chance
at the age of eighteen, making him known and respected as
an ordinary man is on his merits at fifty. Here are thirty years
gained at a stroke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>It is the result of power and not of custom. For those who are
able to originate are few, the greater number will only follow, and
refuse glory to those inventors who seek it by their inventions.
And if they persist in wishing to gain glory, and in despising
those who do not originate, the others will give them ridicule
and would fain give them blows. Let no one then pride himself
on this subtle capacity, or else let him keep his content to himself.</p>

<br />

<p><em>The reason of effects.</em>&mdash;It is strange that men would not have
me honour a man clothed in brocade, and followed by seven or
eight footmen! Yet he will have them give me the strap if I do
not salute him. This custom is a power. It is the same with a
horse in fine trappings compared with another. It is odd that
Montaigne does not see what difference there is, wonders that
we find any, and asks the reason. "Indeed," he says, "how
comes it," etc....</p>

<br />

<p>When power attacks craft, when a mere soldier takes the square
cap of a first president, and flings it out of the window.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Injustice</em>.&mdash;Men have found no means to gratify their sensuality
without wrong to others.</p>

<br />

<p>The greatness of man even in his sensuality, to have known
how to extract from it an admirable code, and to have drawn
from it a picture of love to others.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Greatness.</em>&mdash;The reasons of effects mark the greatness of man,
in having formed so fair an order out of sensuality.</p>

<br />

<p><em>The reason of effects.</em>&mdash;Sensuality and power are the source of
all our actions; sensuality causes those which are voluntary,
power the involuntary.</p>

<br />

<p>From sensuality men have found and drawn excellent rules
of policy, of morals, and of justice.</p>

<p>But after all, this evil root of man, this <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">figmentum malum</i>, is
only hidden, it is not removed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>All men by nature hate each other. They have used sensuality
as best they could to make it serve the public weal, but this is only
a feint, and a false image of charity, for at bottom it is but hate.</p>

<br />

<p>To pity the unfortunate is not contrary to sensuality, rather
is it easy to render this evidence of friendship, and to gain the
reputation of a tender heart, without giving.</p>

<p>The people have very sound opinions, for instance:</p>

<p>1. In having preferred diversion and hunting to poetry.
The half educated deride this, and are triumphant over the
folly of the world, but the people are right by a reason which the
others do not understand.</p>

<p>2. In distinguishing men by outward marks, as birth or
wealth. The world is again triumphant in showing how unreasonable
this is, yet it is thoroughly reasonable. Savages
laugh at an infant king.</p>

<p>3. In taking offence at a blow, or in desiring glory so strongly.</p>

<p>But it is very desirable, on account of the other essential
goods which are joined to it, and a man who has received a blow
without resenting it is overwhelmed with abuse and indignity.</p>

<p>4. In working for an uncertainty, in going on a sea voyage,
in walking over a plank.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Sound opinions of the people.</em>&mdash;Civil wars are the greatest of
all evils. They are certain, if we try to reward desert, for all
will say they deserve. The evil to fear from a fool who succeeds
by right of birth, is neither so great nor so certain.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Sound opinions of the people.</em>&mdash;To be well dressed is not
altogether foolish, for it proves that a great number of people
work for us. It shows by our hair, that we have a valet, a perfumer,
etc.; by our band, our thread, our trimming, etc. Now it
is not merely superficial nor simply outward show to have many
arms at our disposal.</p>

<p>The more arms we have the stronger we are. To be well
dressed is to show our power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<br />

<p><em>The reason of effects.</em>&mdash;Continual alternation of <em>pro</em> and <em>con.</em></p>

<p>We have then shown that man is frivolous, by the estimation
he has of non-essentials. And all these opinions are destroyed.
We have next shown that all these opinions were perfectly
sound, and that thus all these frivolities being well founded,
the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber Note: Original text 'people is'">people are</ins> not so frivolous as is said. And thus we have
destroyed the opinion which destroyed that of the people.</p>

<p>But we must now destroy this last proposition, and show that
it remains always true that the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber Note: Original text 'people is'">people are</ins> frivolous, though its
opinions are sound, because it does not feel the truth where it
is, and placing it where it is not, its opinions are always very
false and very unsound.</p>

<br />

<p><em>The reason of effects.</em>&mdash;It is, then, true to say that all men are
under an illusion, for even though the opinions of the people
be sound, they are not so as they hold them, for they think that
truth is where it is not. Truth is indeed in their opinions, but
not at the point where they imagine it.</p>

<p>Thus, it is true that we should honour men of birth, but not
because good birth is in itself an advantage, etc.</p>

<br />

<p><em>The reason of effects.</em>&mdash;Gradation. The people honours persons
of high birth. The half-educated despise them, saying
that birth is not a personal, but a chance advantage. The educated
honour them, not from the motives of the people, but from
another motive. Devout persons of more zeal than knowledge
despise them, in spite of that consideration which makes them
honoured by the educated, because they judge by a new light
arising from their piety. But true Christians honour them by
a still higher light. So there is a succession of opinions for and
against, according to the measure of our light.</p>

<br />

<p>How rightly do men distinguish by exterior rather than by
interior qualities! Which of us twain shall take the lead?
Who will give place to the other? The least able? But I am as
able as he is. We should have to fight about that. He has four
footmen, and I have but one; that is something which can be
seen; there is nothing to do but to count; it is my place to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
yield, and I am a fool if I contest it. So by this means we
remain at peace, the greatest of all blessings.</p>

<br />

<p>Deference is shown by submitting to personal inconvenience.
This is apparently foolish but really just, for it is to say, "I
would certainly put myself to inconvenience did you need it,
since I do so when it can be of no service to you." Respect,
moreover, is for the purpose of marking distinctions of rank.
Now if it showed respect to be seated in an arm-chair, we should
pay respect to every body, and thus no distinction would be
made, but being put to inconvenience we distinguish very well.</p>

<br />

<p><em>The reason of effects.</em>&mdash;We should keep our own secret
thoughts, and judge of all by those, while speaking like every
one else.</p>

<br />

<p><em>King and tyrant.</em>&mdash;I too will have my secret thoughts. I will
take care on every journey.</p>

<br />

<p><em>The reason of effects.</em>&mdash;Epictetus. Those who say "You have a
headache," this is not the same thing. We are assured of
health, and not of justice, and indeed his own was folly.</p>

<p>Yet he believed it demonstrable when he said, "it is either in
our power or it is not."</p>

<p>But he did not see that it is not in our power to regulate the
heart, and he was wrong to draw this conclusion from the fact
that some were Christians.</p>

<br />

<p><em>The reason of effects.</em>&mdash;It is owing to the weakness of man
that so many things are esteemed beautiful, as to be well skilled
in playing the lute.</p>

<p>It is only an evil because of our weakness.</p>

DEFECTS OF MAN.</em></a></h3>
</div>

    <div>

<p class="noindent"><em>The Misery of Man.</em>&mdash;We care nothing for the present. We
anticipate the future as too slow in coming, as if we could make
it move faster; or we call back the past, to stop its rapid flight.
So imprudent are we that we wander through the times in which
we have no part, unthinking of that which alone is ours; so
frivolous are we that we dream of the days which are not, and
pass by without reflection those which alone exist. For the
present generally gives us pain; we conceal it from our sight
because it afflicts us, and if it be pleasant we regret to see it
vanish away. We endeavour to sustain the present by the
future, and think of arranging things not in our power, for a
time at which we have no certainty of arriving.</p>

<p>If we examine our thoughts, we shall find them always occupied
with the past or the future. We scarcely think of the
present, and if we do so, it is only that we may borrow light
from it to direct the future. The present is never our end;
the past and the present are our means, the future alone is our
end. Thus we never live, but hope to live, and while we always
lay ourselves out to be happy, it is inevitable that we can never
be so.</p>

<br />

<p>We are so unhappy that we cannot take pleasure in a thing,
save on condition of being troubled if it turn out ill, as a thousand
things may do, and do every hour. He who should find the
secret of rejoicing in good without being troubled at its contrary
evil, would have hit the mark. It is perpetual motion.</p>

<br />

<p>Our nature exists by motion; perfect rest is death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<br />

<p>When we are well we wonder how we should get on if we
were sick, but when sickness comes we take our medicine
cheerfully, into that the evil resolves itself. We have no longer
those passions and that desire for amusement and gadding
abroad, which were ours in health, but are now incompatible
with the necessities of our disease. So then nature gives us
passions and desires in accordance with the immediate situation.
Nothing troubles us but fears, which we, and not nature, make
for ourselves, because fear adds to the condition in which we are
the passions of the condition in which we are not.</p>

<p>Since nature makes us always unhappy in every condition,
our desires paint for us a happy condition, joining to that in
which we are, the pleasures of the condition in which we are not,
and were we to gain these pleasures we should not therefore be
happy, because we should have other desires conformable to
this new estate.</p>

<p>We must particularize this general proposition....</p>

<br />

<p>What difference in point of obedience is there between a
soldier and a Carthusian? For both are alike under rule and dependent,
both engaged in equally irksome labours. But the
soldier always hopes to bear rule, and though he never does so,
for even captains and princes are always slaves and dependents,
he ever hopes and ever works to attain mastery, whereas the
Carthusian makes a vow never to be aught else than dependent.
Thus they do not differ in their perpetual servitude, which is the
same always for both, but in the hope which one always has,
the other never.</p>

<br />

<p>The example of Alexander's chastity has not made so many
continent as that of his drunkenness has made intemperate. It
is not shameful to be less virtuous than he, and it seems excusable
to be no more vicious. We do not think ourselves wholly partakers
in the vices of ordinary men, when we see that we share those
of the great, not considering that in such matters the great are
but ordinary men. We hold on to them by the same end by
which they hold on to the people, for at whatsoever height they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
be, they are yet united at some point to the lowest of mankind.
They are not suspended in the air, abstracted from our society.
No, doubly no; if they are greater than we, it is because their
heads are higher; but their feet are as low as ours. There all
are on the same level, resting on the same earth, and by the
lower extremity are as low as we are, as the meanest men, as
children, and the brutes.</p>

<br />

<p>Great men and little have the same accidents, the same
tempers, the same passions, but one is on the felloe of the
wheel, the other near the axle, and so less agitated by the same
revolutions.</p>

<br />

<p>Would he who had enjoyed the friendship of the King of
England, the King of Poland, and the Queen of Sweden have
thought he should come to want, and need a retreat or shelter
in the world?</p>

<br />

<p>Man is full of wants, and cares only for those who can satisfy
them all. "Such an one is a good mathematician," it is said.
But I have nothing to do with mathematics, he would take me
for a proposition. "This other is a good soldier." He would
treat me as a besieged city. I need then an honourable man
who can lend himself generally to all my wants.</p>

<br />

<p>Men say that eclipses presage misfortune, because misfortunes
are common, so that as evil often happens they often
divine it; whereas to say that they presage happiness would
often prove false. They attribute happiness only to rare planetary
conjunctions, and thus they seldom fail in their divination.</p>

<br />

<p>We are fools if we rest content with the society of those like
ourselves; miserable as we are, powerless as we are, they will
not aid us, we shall die alone. We ought therefore to act as
though we were alone, and should we in that case build superb
mansions, etc.? We should search for truth unhesitatingly, and
if we refuse it, we show that we value the esteem of men more
than the search for truth.</p>

<br />

<p>The last act is tragic, how pleasantly soever the play may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
have run through the others. At the end a little earth is flung
on our head, and all is over for ever.</p>

<br />

<p>I feel that I might not have been, for the 'I' consists in my
thought; therefore I, who think, had not been had my mother
been killed before I had life. So I am not a necessary being.
Neither am I eternal nor infinite, but I see plainly there is in
nature a necessary being, eternal and infinite.</p>

<br />

<p>As duchies, kingships, and magistracies are real and necessary,
because power rules all, these exist every where and always.
But since it is only caprice which makes one or another duke
or king, the rule is not constant, and may vary, etc.</p>

<br />

<p>Cromwell was about to ravage the whole of Christendom, the
royal family had been brought to nought, and his own dynasty
for ever established, but for a little grain of sand in his bladder.
Rome herself began to tremble under him, but this scrap of
gravel having got there, he dies, his family falls from power,
peace is established, and the king restored.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Scepticism.</em>&mdash;Excessive or deficient mental powers are alike
accused of madness. Nothing is good but mediocrity. The
majority has settled that, and assails whoever escapes it, no
matter by which extreme. I make no objection, would
willingly consent to be in the mean, and I refuse to be
placed at the lower end, not because it is low, but because it
is an extreme, for I would equally refuse to be placed at the
top. To leave the mean is to leave humanity. The greatness
of the human soul consists in knowing how to keep the mean.
So little is it the case that greatness consists in leaving it, that
it lies in not leaving it.</p>

<br />

<p>Discourses on humility give occasion for pride to the boastful,
and for humility to the humble. Those on scepticism give
occasion for believers to affirm. Few men speak humbly of
humility, chastely of chastity, few of scepticism doubtingly. We
are but falsehood, duplicity and contradiction, using even
to ourselves concealment and guile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<br />

<p>There are vices which only take hold of us by means of others,
and these, like branches, fall with the removal of the trunk.</p>

<br />

<p>For we must not mistake ourselves, we have as much that is
automatic in us as intellectual, and hence it comes that the
instrument by which persuasion is brought about is not demonstration
alone. How few things are demonstrated! Proofs
can only convince the mind; custom makes our strongest proofs
and those which we hold most firmly, it sways the automaton,
which draws the unconscious intellect after it. Who has demonstrated
that there will be a to-morrow, or that we shall die;
yet what is more universally believed? It is then custom that
convinces us of it, custom that makes so many men Christians,
custom that makes them Turks, heathen, artisans, soldiers, etc.
Lastly, we must resort to custom when once the mind has seen
where truth is, in order to slake our thirst, and steep ourselves in
that belief, which escapes us at every hour, for to have proofs
always at hand were too onerous. We must acquire a more
easy belief, that of custom, which without violence, without art,
without argument, causes our assent and inclines all our powers
to this belief, so that our soul naturally falls into it. It is not
enough to believe only by force of conviction if the automaton is
inclined to believe the contrary. Both parts of us then must be
obliged to believe, the intellect by arguments which it is enough
to have admitted once in our lives, the automaton by custom,
and by not allowing it to incline in the contrary direction. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Inclina
cor meum, Deus.</i></p>

<br />

<p>The intellect believes naturally, and the will loves naturally,
so that for lack of true objects, they must needs attach themselves
to the false.</p>

<br />

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eritis sicut dii, scientes bonum et malum.</i>&mdash;Every one plays
the god in judging whether anything be good or bad, and in
being too much afflicted or rejoiced at circumstances.</p>

<br />

<p>Even if people have no interest in what they say, it must not
therefore be certainly concluded they are not lying, for there
are those who lie simply for lying's sake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<br />

<p>Men are of necessity so mad, that not to be mad were madness
in another form.</p>

<br />

<p>We cannot think of Plato and Aristotle, save in professorial
robes. They were honest men like others, laughing with their
friends, and when they amused themselves with writing the
<em>Laws</em> or the <em>Politics</em>, they did it as a pastime. That part of their
life was the least philosophic and the least serious; the most
philosophic was to live simply and quietly. If they wrote on
politics it was as though they were laying down rules for a madhouse,
and if they made as though they were speaking of a great
matter, it was because they knew that the madmen to whom they
spoke fancied themselves kings and emperors. They entered into
their views in order to make their folly as little harmful as possible.</p>

<br />

<p>The most important affair in life is the choice of a trade,
yet chance decides it. Custom makes men masons, soldiers,
tilers. "He is a good tiler," says one, "and soldiers are fools."
But others: "There is nothing great but war, all but soldiers are
rogues." We choose our professions according as we hear this or
that praised or despised in our childhood, for we naturally love
truth and hate folly. These words move us, the only fault is in
their application. So great is the force of custom that out of those
who by nature are only men, are made all conditions of men.
For some countries are full of masons, others of soldiers, etc.
Nature is certainly not so uniform. Custom then produces this
effect and gains ascendency over nature, yet sometimes nature
gets the upper hand, and obliges man to act by instinct in spite
of all custom, whether good or bad.</p>

<br />

<p>Men by nature are tilers and of all callings, except in their own
closets.</p>

<br />

<p>We never teach men to be gentlemen, but we teach them
everything else, and they never pique themselves so much on all
the rest as on knowing how to be gentlemen. They pique themselves
only on knowing the one thing they have not learnt.</p>

<br />

<p>People should not be able to say of a man, he is a mathematician,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
or a preacher, or eloquent, but he is a gentleman; that
universal quality alone pleases me.&mdash;When you think of a man's
book as soon as you see himself, it is a bad sign. I would
rather that none of his qualities should be recognised till you
meet them, or have occasion to avail yourself of them. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ne quid
nimis</i>, for fear some one quality gain the mastery and stamp the
man. Let not people think of him as an orator, unless oratory
be in question, then let them think of it.</p>

<br />

<p>No man passes in the world as an expert in verse unless he
hang out the sign of a poet, a mathematician, etc. But people
who are generally accomplished need no sign and scarce recognise
any difference between the trade of a poet and that of an
embroiderer.</p>

<p>People of general accomplishment are not called poets or
geometricians, etc., though they are so, and judges of all these.
You do not guess what they are. When they enter a society
they join in the general conversation. They do not exhibit
one quality rather than another, except when they have to
make use of it. Then we remember it, for it is natural to
such characters that we do not say of them that they are fine
speakers when it is not a question of oratory, and that we give
them the praise of eloquence if occasion call for it.</p>

<p>It is false praise then to say of a man as soon as he enters a
society that he is a clever poet, and it is a bad sign when a
man is never called on to give his opinion on such a subject as
verse.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Inconstancy.</em>&mdash;Things have different qualities, and the soul
different inclinations; for nothing is simple which presents
itself to the soul, and the soul never presents itself simply to
any subject. Hence it comes that men laugh and weep at the
same thing.</p>

<br />

<p>Greatness of establishment, respect for establishment.</p>

<p>The pleasure of the great is to be able to make people happy.</p>

<p>The property of riches is to be given liberally.</p>

<p>The property of each thing should be sought out. The property
of power is to protect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<br />

<p>Saint Augustine saw that we labour for an uncertainty, at sea,
in a battle, etc.; he did not see the doctrine of chances, which
demonstrates that we must do so. Montaigne saw that we are
disgusted at a distorted mind, and that custom can do all
things, but he did not see the reason of that effect.</p>

<p>All these men saw the effects, but did not see the causes; in
relation to those who have discovered the causes they are as those
who have only eyes are in regard to those who have intellect.
For the effects are as it were sensible, and the causes are visible
only to the intellect. And though these effects too are apprehended
through reason, yet is it in relation to the reason which
apprehends causes, as the bodily senses are to the intellect.</p>

<br />

<p>Suppose a man puts himself at a window to see the passers
by. If I pass I cannot say that he stood there to see me, for he
does not think of me in particular. Nor does any one who loves
another on account of beauty really love that person, for the
small-pox, which kills beauty without killing the person, will cause
the loss of love. Nor does one who loves me for my judgment,
my memory, love me, myself, for I may lose those qualities
without losing my identity. Where then is this 'I' if it reside not
in the body nor in the soul, and how love the body or the soul,
except for the qualities which do not make '<em>me</em>,' since they are
perishable? For it is not possible and it would be unjust to love
the soul of a person in the abstract, and whatever qualities might
be therein. So then we do not love a person, but only qualities.
We should not then sneer at those who are honoured on account
of rank and office, for we love no one save for borrowed qualities.</p>

<br />

<p>Time heals all pain and misunderstanding, because we change
and are no longer the same persons. Neither the offender nor
the offended are any more themselves. It is like a nation which
we have angered and meet again after two generations. They
are Frenchmen still, but not the same.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Inconstancy and singularity.</em>&mdash;To live only by labour, and
to reign over the most powerful state in the world, are very
opposite things. They are united in the person of the grand
Sultan of the Turks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>It pleases us to say 'Prince' to a king, because it lessens
his quality.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Epigrams of Martial.</em>&mdash;Men like malice, but not against one-eyed
men, nor against the unfortunate, but against the fortunate
and proud. Those who think otherwise make a mistake.</p>

<p>For concupiscence is the source of all our movements, and
humanity, etc.</p>

<p>We must please those whose feelings are humane and tender.</p>

<p>That epigram about the two one-eyed people is valueless, for
it brings them no consolation, and only gives a point to the
author's glory. All that is merely for the sake of the author is
valueless. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ambitiosa recidet ornamenta.</i></p>

<br />

<p>I put it down as a fact that if all men knew what each said of
the other, there would not be four friends in the world. This is
evident from the quarrels which arise from indiscreet reports
made from time to time.</p>

<br />

<p>Those who are always hopeful in adversity, and rejoice in
good luck, are suspected of being glad of failure should they
not be correspondingly depressed under bad luck; they are
delighted to find pretexts for hoping, in order to show that
they are interested, and to hide by the joy they pretend to feel
that which they really feel at the ill success of the affair.</p>

<br />

<p>Malignity when it has reason on its side becomes proud, and
displays reason in all its splendour.</p>

<p>If austerity or a rigid choice have not found the true good,
and we must needs return to follow nature, it becomes proud by
reason of this return.</p>

<br />

<p>A maker of epigrams,&mdash;a bad man.</p>

<br />

<p>Do you wish men to believe good of you? Then say none.</p>

<br />

<p>We ought to be much obliged to those who tell us of our
faults, for they mortify us, they teach us we have been despised,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
they do not prevent our being so in the future, for we have
many other faults which are despicable. They prepare for us
the exercise of correction, and freedom from a fault.</p>

<br />

<p>If we would reprove with success, and show another his mistake,
we must see from what side he views the matter, for on
that side it is generally true, and admitting that truth, show him
the side on which it is false. He will be satisfied, for he will
see that he was not mistaken, only that he did not see all sides.
Now, no one is vexed at not seeing every thing. But we do not
like to be mistaken, and that perhaps arises from the fact that
man by nature cannot see everything, and that by nature he
cannot be mistaken in the side he looks at, since what we
apprehend by our senses is always true.</p>

<br />

<p>I passed a long time in the study of the abstract sciences, and
was much discouraged at finding how few were my fellow-students.
When I began the study of man I saw that these
abstract sciences were not fit for him, and that I was wandering
more from my true state in investigating them, than others
in ignoring them. I forgave their scanty knowledge. But
I thought at least to find many fellow-students in the study of
man, and that this was the real study which befits us. I was
deceived, for there are still fewer than those who study mathematics.
It is only for want of knowing how to pursue this study
that we seek others. But is it not that even here is not the
knowledge that man should have, and that it is better for him to
be ignorant of himself in order to be happy?</p>

<br />

<p><em>The Vanity of Knowledge.</em>&mdash;The knowledge of external things
will not console me for my ignorance of ethics in time of affliction,
but the science of morals will always console me for my ignorance
of external knowledge.</p>

<br />

<p>There are plants on the earth, we see them, but they could
not be seen from the moon. On these plants are hairs, and in
these hairs tiny animals, but beyond that, nothing more. O, presumption!
Compound bodies are made up of elements, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
not the elementary bodies themselves. O presumption! Here
is a fine distinction. We must not assert the existence of what
we cannot see, we must then say what others say, but not think
with them.</p>

<br />

<p>The world's judgment is right, for it is in that condition
of natural ignorance which is man's best wisdom. The
sciences have two extremes which meet. The first is that pure
natural ignorance in which every man is born. The other extreme
is that reached by great minds, who having run through
all that men can know, find that they know nothing, and again
come round to the same ignorance from which they started; but
this is a learned ignorance, conscious of itself. Those between
the two, who have left their natural ignorance and not been able
to reach the other, have some tincture of this vain knowledge,
and assume to be wise. These trouble the world, and judge
all things falsely. The people and the wise make up the world;
these despise it, and are despised; they judge ill of all things,
and the world rightly judges of them.</p>

<br />

<p>Nature has made all her truths self-contained. Our art
encloses them one within another, but that is not according to
nature. Each holds its own place.</p>

<br />

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Spongia solis.</i>&mdash;When we see the same effect invariably recur
we conclude there is in it a natural necessity, as that there will be
a to-morrow, etc. But nature often gives us the lie, and will not
subject herself to her own rules.</p>

<br />

<p>Nature always begins the same things again, years, days, and
hours, and in like manner spaces and numbers follow each other,
end without end. So is made a sort of infinity and eternity,
not that any thing of these is infinite and eternal, but these finite
entities are infinitely multiplied.</p>

<p>Thus as it seems to me the number which multiplies them
alone is infinite.</p>

<br />

<p>Nature imitates herself. A seed sown in good ground brings
forth fruit. A principle cast into a good mind brings forth fruit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>Numbers imitate space, which is of an wholly different nature.</p>

<p>All is made and guided by one and the same master, root,
branch and fruits; principles and consequences.</p>

<br />

<p>Nature works by progress, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">itus et reditus</i>. It goes and returns,
then it goes further, then twice as much backwards, then more
forward than ever, etc.</p>

<p>So is it with the tide of the sea, and so apparently with the
course of the sun.</p>

<br />

<p>Every one is all in all to himself, for he being dead, all
is dead to him. Hence it comes that each man believes that
he is all to all. We ought not to judge of nature by ourselves,
but by it.</p>

<br />

<p>Self is hateful. You Miton, conceal self, but do not thereby
destroy it, therefore you are still hateful.</p>

<p>&mdash;Not so, for in acting as we do, to oblige every body, we give
no reason for hating us.&mdash;True, if we only hated in self the
vexation which it causes us.</p>

<p>But if I hate it because it is unjust, and because it makes
itself the centre of all, I shall always hate it.</p>

<p>In one word Self has two qualities, it is unjust in its essence
because it makes itself the centre of all, it is inconvenient to
others, in that it would bring them into subjection, for each 'I'
is the enemy, and would fain be the tyrant of all others. You
take away the inconvenience, but not the injustice, and thus you
do not render it loveable to those who hate injustice; you render
it loveable only to the unjust, who find in it an enemy no longer.
Thus you remain unjust and can please none but the unjust.</p>

<p><em>Of Self-love.</em>&mdash;The nature of self-love and of this human 'I'
is to love self only, and consider self only. But what can it
do? It cannot prevent the object it loves from being full of
faults and miseries; man would fain be great and sees that he
is little, would fain be happy, and sees that he is miserable,
would fain be perfect, and sees that he is full of imperfections,
would fain be the object of the love and esteem of men, and sees
that his faults merit only their aversion and contempt. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
embarrassment wherein he finds himself produces in him the
most unjust and criminal passion imaginable, for he conceives a
mortal hatred against that truth which blames him and convinces
him of his faults. Desiring to annihilate it, yet unable to
destroy it in its essence, he destroys it as much as he can in his
own knowledge, and in that of others; that is to say, he devotes
all his care to the concealment of his faults, both from others
and from himself, and he can neither bear that others should
show them to him, nor that they should see them.</p>

<p>It is no doubt an evil to be full of faults, but it is a greater
evil to be full of them, yet unwilling to recognise them, because
that is to add the further fault of a voluntary illusion. We do
not like others to deceive us, we do not think it just in them to
require more esteem from us than they deserve; it is therefore
unjust that we should deceive them, desiring more esteem from
them than we deserve.</p>

<p>Thus if they discover no more imperfections and vices in us
than we really have, it is plain they do us no wrong, since it
is not they who cause them; but rather they do us a service,
since they help us to deliver ourselves from an evil, the
ignorance of these imperfections. We ought not to be troubled
that they know our faults and despise us, since it is but just
they should know us as we are, and despise us if we are
despicable.</p>

<p>Such are the sentiments which would arise in a heart full of
equity and justice. What should we say then of our own heart,
finding in it an wholly contrary disposition? For is it not
true that we hate truth, and those who tell it us, and that we
would wish them to have an erroneously favourable opinion
of us, and to esteem us other than indeed we are?</p>

<p>One proof of this fills me with dismay. The Catholic religion
does not oblige us to tell out our sins indiscriminately to all, it
allows us to remain hidden from men in general, but she excepts
one alone, to whom she commands us to open the very
depths of our heart, and to show ourselves to him as we are.
There is but this one man in the world whom she orders us to
undeceive; she binds him to an inviolable secrecy, so that this
knowledge is to him as though it were not. We can imagine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
nothing more charitable and more tender. Yet such is the
corruption of man, that he finds even this law harsh, and it is
one of the main reasons which has set a large portion of Europe
in revolt against the Church.</p>

<p>How unjust and unreasonable is the human heart which finds
it hard to be obliged to do in regard to one man what in some
degree it were just to do to all men. For is it just that we should
deceive them?</p>

<p>There are different degrees in this dislike to the truth, but it
may be said that all have it in some degree, for it is inseparable
from self-love. This false delicacy causes those who must needs
reprove others to choose so many windings and modifications in
order to avoid shocking them. They must needs lessen our faults,
seem to excuse them, mix praises with their blame, give evidences
of affection and esteem. Yet this medicine is always
bitter to self-love, which takes as little as it can, always with disgust,
often with a secret anger against those who administer it.</p>

<p>Hence it happens, that if any desire our love, they avoid doing
us a service which they know to be disagreeable; they treat us
as we would wish to be treated: we hate the truth, and they
hide it from us; we wish to be flattered, they flatter us; we love
to be deceived, they deceive us.</p>

<p>Thus each degree of good fortune which raises us in the
world removes us further from truth, because we fear most to
wound those whose affection is most useful, and whose dislike
is most dangerous. A prince may be the by-word of all Europe,
yet he alone know nothing of it. I am not surprised; to speak
the truth is useful to whom it is spoken, but disadvantageous to
those who speak it, since it makes them hated. Now those who
live with princes love their own interests more than that of the
prince they serve, and thus they take care not to benefit him so
as to do themselves a disservice.</p>

<p>This misfortune is, no doubt, greater and more common in
the higher classes, but lesser men are not exempt from it, since
there is always an interest in making men love us. Thus human
life is but a perpetual illusion, an interchange of deceit and
flattery. No one speaks of us in our presence as in our absence.
The society of men is founded on this universal deceit: few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
friendships would last if every man knew what his friend said of
him behind his back, though he then spoke in sincerity and
without passion.</p>

<p>Man is then only disguise, falsehood, and hypocrisy, both in
himself and with regard to others. He will not be told the
truth, he avoids telling it to others, and all these tendencies, so
far removed from justice and reason, have their natural roots in
his heart.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>PREFACE TO THE SECOND PART.</em></a></h3>
</div>

    <div>

<p class="noindent">To speak of those who have treated of this subject.</p>

<p>I wonder at the boldness with which these persons undertake
to speak of God, in addressing their words to the irreligious.
Their first chapter is to prove Divinity by the works of nature.
I should not be astonished at their undertaking if they
addressed their argument to the faithful, for it is certain that
those who have a lively faith in their heart see at once that all
that exists is none other than the work of the God whom they
adore. But for those in whom this light is extinguished, and in
whom we desire to revive it, men destitute of faith and grace
who, seeking with all their light whatever they see in nature to
lead them to this knowledge, find only clouds and darkness,&mdash;to
tell them they need only look at the smallest things which
surround them in order to see God unveiled, to give them as
the sole proof of this great and important subject, the course of
the moon and planets, and to say that with such an argument we
have accomplished the proof; is to give them ground for belief
that the proofs of our Religion are very feeble. Indeed I see by
reason and experience that nothing is more fitted to excite
contempt.</p>

<p>Not after this fashion speaks the Scripture, which knows
better than we the things of God. It says, on the contrary,
that God is a God who hides himself, and that since nature
became corrupt, he has left men in a blindness from which
they can only escape by Jesus Christ, and except through him
we are cut off from all communication with God. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nemo novit
Patrem, nisi Filius, et cui voluerit Filius revelare.</i></p>

<p>This is what Scripture indicates when it says in so many
places that those who seek God find him. It is not of a light
like the sun at noonday that they thus speak. No one says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
that those who seek the sun at noonday, or water in the sea
shall find them, and thus it follows that the evidence for God is
not of that kind. Therefore it says to us elsewhere: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vere tu es
Deus absconditus</i>.</p>

<br />

<p>The metaphysical proofs of God are so apart from man's
reason, and so complicated that they are but little striking, and
if they are of use to any, it is only during the moment that the
demonstration is before them, but an hour afterwards they fear
they have been mistaken.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quod curiositate cognoverint, superbia amiserunt.</i></p>

<p>Such is the outcome of the knowledge of God gained without
Jesus Christ, for this is to communicate without a mediator with
the God whom they have known without a mediator.</p>

<p>Instead of which those who have known God by a mediator
know their own wretchedness.</p>

<br />

<p>Jesus Christ is the goal of all, and the centre to which all
tends. Who knows him knows the reason of all things.</p>

<p>Those who go astray only do so from failing to see one of
these two things. It is then possible to know God without
knowing our wretchedness, and to know our wretchedness
without knowing God; but we cannot know Jesus Christ
without knowing at the same time God and our wretchedness.</p>

<p>Therefore I do not here undertake to prove by natural reasons
either the existence of God or the Trinity, or the immortality
of the soul, nor anything of that sort, not only because I
do not feel myself strong enough to find in nature proofs to
convince hardened atheists, but also, because this knowledge
without Jesus Christ is useless and barren. Though a man
should be persuaded that the proportions of numbers are
immaterial truths, eternal, and dependent on a first truth in
whom they subsist, and who is called God, I should not consider
him far advanced towards his salvation.</p>

<p>The God of Christians is not a God who is simply the author
of mathematical truths, or of the order of the elements, as is
the god of the heathen and of Epicureans. Nor is he merely a
God who providentially disposes the life and fortunes of men, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
crown his worshippers with length of happy years. Such was the
portion of the Jews. But the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac,
the God of Jacob, the God of Christians, is a God of love and
consolation, a God who fills the souls and hearts of his own, a
God who makes them feel their inward wretchedness, and his
infinite mercy, who unites himself to their inmost spirit, filling
it with humility and joy, with confidence and love, rendering
them incapable of any end other than himself.</p>

<br />

<p>All who seek God apart from Jesus Christ, and who rest in
nature, find no light to satisfy them, but form for themselves a
means of knowing God and serving him without a mediator.
Thus they fall either into atheism, or into deism, two things
which the Christian religion almost equally abhors.</p>

<br />

<p>The God of Christians is a God who makes the soul perceive
that he is her only good, that her only rest is in him, her
only joy in loving him; who makes her at the same time
abhor the obstacles which withhold her from loving him with
all her strength. Her two hindrances, self-love and lust, are
insupportable to her. This God makes her perceive that the
root of self-love destroys her, and that he alone can heal.</p>

<br />

<p>The knowledge of God without that of our wretchedness
creates pride. The knowledge of our wretchedness without
that of God creates despair. The knowledge of Jesus Christ
is the middle way, because in him we find both God and our
wretchedness.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>OF THE NEED OF SEEKING TRUTH.</em></a></h3>
</div>

    <div>

<p><em>Second Part. That man without faith cannot know the
true good, nor justice.</em></p>

<p>All men seek happiness. To this there is no exception, what
different means soever they employ, all tend to this goal. The
reason that some men go to the wars and others avoid them is
but the same desire attended in each with different views. Our
will makes no step but towards this object. This is the motive
of every action of every man, even of him who hangs himself.</p>

<p>And yet after so many years, no one without faith has arrived
at the point to which all eyes are turned. All complain, princes
and subjects, nobles and commons, old and young, strong and
weak, learned and ignorant, sound and sick, of all countries, all
times, all ages, and all conditions.</p>

<p>A trial so long, so constant and so uniform, should surely
convince us of our inability to arrive at good by our own strength,
but example teaches us but little. No resemblance is so exact but
that there is some slight difference, and hence we expect that our
endeavour will not be foiled on this occasion as before. Thus
while the present never satisfies, experience deceives us, and from
misfortune to misfortune leads us on to death, eternal crown of
sorrows.</p>

<p>This desire, and this weakness cry aloud to us that there was
once in man a true happiness, of which there now remains to
him but the mark and the empty trace, which he vainly tries
to fill from all that surrounds him, seeking from things absent
the succour he finds not in things present; and these are all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
inadequate, because this infinite void can only be filled by an
infinite and immutable object, that is to say, only by God
himself.</p>

<p>He only is our true good, and since we have left him, it is
strange that there is nothing in nature which has not served to
take his place; neither the stars, nor heaven, earth, the elements,
plants, cabbages, leeks, animals, insects, calves, serpents, fever,
pestilence, war, famine, vices, adultery, incest. And since he has
lost the true good, all things can equally appear good to him,
even his own destruction, though so contrary to God, to reason,
and to the whole course of nature.</p>

<p>Some seek good in authority, others in research and knowledge,
others in pleasure. Others, who indeed are nearer the
truth, have considered it necessary that the universal good
which all men desire should not consist in any of those particular
matters which can only be possessed by one, and which if
once shared, afflict their possessor more by the want of what
he has not, than they gladden him by the joy of what he has.
They have apprehended that the true good should be such as all
may possess at once, without diminution, and without envy, and
that which none can lose against his will. And their reason is
that this desire being natural to man, since it exists necessarily
in all, and that all must have it, they conclude from it....</p>

<br />

<p><em>Infinite, nothing.</em>&mdash;The soul of man is cast into the body, in
which it finds number, time, dimension; it reasons thereon,
and calls this nature or necessity, and cannot believe aught
else.</p>

<p>Unity joined to infinity increases it not, any more than a foot
measure added to infinite space. The finite is annihilated in
presence of the infinite and becomes simply nought. Thus our
intellect before God, thus our justice before the divine justice.
There is not so great a disproportion between our justice and
that of God, as between unity and infinity.</p>

<p>The justice of God must be as vast as his mercy, but justice
towards the reprobate is less vast, and should be less amazing
than mercy towards the elect.</p>

<p>We know that there is an infinite, but are ignorant of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
nature. As we know it to be false that numbers are finite, it
must therefore be true that there is an infinity in number, but
what this is we know not. It can neither be odd nor even,
for the addition of an unit can make no change in the
nature of number; yet it is a number, and every number is
either odd or even, at least this is understood of every finite
number.</p>

<p>Thus we may well know that there is a God, without knowing
what he is.</p>

<p>We know then the existence and the nature of the finite,
because we also are finite and have dimension.</p>

<p>We know the existence of the infinite, and are ignorant of its
nature, because it has dimension like us, but not limits like us.
But we know neither the existence nor the nature of God, because
he has neither dimension nor limits.</p>

<p>But by faith we know his existence, by glory we shall know
his nature. Now I have already shown that we can know well
the existence of a thing without knowing its nature.</p>

<p>Let us now speak according to the light of nature.</p>

<p>If there be a God, he is infinitely incomprehensible, since
having neither parts nor limits he has no relation to us. We
are then incapable of knowing either what he is or if he is.
This being so, who will dare to undertake the solution of the
question? Not we, who have no relation to him.</p>

<p>Who then will blame Christians for not being able to give a
reason for their faith; those who profess a religion for which they
cannot give a reason? They declare in putting it forth to the
world that it is a foolishness, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">stultitiam</i>, and then you complain
that they do not prove it. Were they to prove it they would not
keep their word, it is in lacking proof that they are not lacking
in sense.&mdash;Yes, but although this excuses those who offer it as
such, and takes away from them the blame of putting it forth
without reason, it does not excuse those who receive it.&mdash;Let us
then examine this point, and say "God is, or he is not." But to
which side shall we incline? Reason can determine nothing
about it. There is an infinite gulf fixed between us. A game
is playing at the extremity of this infinite distance in which heads
or tails may turn up. What will you wager? There is no reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
for backing either one or the other, you cannot reasonably
argue in favour of either.</p>

<p>Do not then accuse of error those who have already chosen,
for you know nothing about it.&mdash;No, but I blame them for having
made, not this choice, but a choice, for again both the man who
calls 'heads' and his adversary are equally to blame, they are
both in the wrong; the true course is not to wager at all.&mdash;</p>

<p>Yes, but you must wager; this depends not on your will, you
are embarked in the affair. Which will you choose? Let us see.
Since you must choose, let us see which least interests you. You
have two things to lose, truth and good, and two things to stake,
your reason and your will, your knowledge and your happiness;
and your nature has two things to avoid, error and misery.
Since you must needs choose, your reason is no more wounded
in choosing one than the other. Here is one point cleared up, but
what of your happiness? Let us weigh the gain and the loss in
choosing heads that God is. Let us weigh the two cases: if you
gain, you gain all; if you lose, you lose nothing. Wager then
unhesitatingly that he is.&mdash;You are right. Yes, I must wager,
but I may stake too much.&mdash;Let us see. Since there is an
equal chance of gain and loss, if you had only to gain two lives
for one, you might still wager. But were there three of them to
gain, you would have to play, since needs must that you play, and
you would be imprudent, since you must play, not to chance your
life to gain three at a game where the chances of loss or gain are
even. But there is an eternity of life and happiness. And that
being so, were there an infinity of chances of which one only
would be for you, you would still be right to stake one to win two,
and you would act foolishly, being obliged to play, did you refuse
to stake one life against three at a game in which out of an
infinity of chances there be one for you, if there were an infinity
of an infinitely happy life to win. But there is here an infinity
of an infinitely happy life to win, a chance of gain against a finite
number of chances of loss, and what you stake is finite; that
is decided. Wherever the infinite exists and there is not
an infinity of chances of loss against that of gain, there is no
room for hesitation, you must risk the whole. Thus when a man
is forced to play he must renounce reason to keep life, rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
than hazard it for infinite gain, which is as likely to happen as
the loss of nothingness.</p>

<p>For it is of no avail to say it is uncertain that we gain, and
certain that we risk, and that the infinite distance between the
certainty of that which is staked and the uncertainty of what we
shall gain, equals the finite good which is certainly staked
against an uncertain infinite. This is not so. Every gambler
stakes a certainty to gain an uncertainty, and yet he stakes a
finite certainty against a finite uncertainty without acting
unreasonably. It is false to say there is infinite distance
between the certain stake and the uncertain gain. There is
in truth an infinity between the certainty of gain and the
certainty of loss. But the uncertainty of gain is proportioned
to the certainty of the stake, according to the proportion of
chances of gain and loss, and if therefore there are as many
chances on one side as on the other, the game is even. And thus
the certainty of the venture is equal to the uncertainty of the
winnings, so far is it from the truth that there is infinite distance
between them. So that our argument is of infinite force, if we
stake the finite in a game where there are equal chances of gain
and loss, and the infinite is the winnings. This is demonstrable,
and if men are capable of any truths, this is one.</p>

<p>I confess and admit it. Yet is there no means of seeing the
hands at the game?&mdash;Yes, the Scripture and the rest, etc.</p>

<p>&mdash;Well, but my hands are tied and my mouth is gagged: I am
forced to wager and am not free, none can release me, but I am so
made that I cannot believe. What then would you have me do?</p>

<p>True. But understand at least your incapacity to believe,
since your reason leads you to belief and yet you cannot
believe. Labour then to convince yourself, not by increase of the
proofs of God, but by the diminution of your passions. You
would fain arrive at faith, but know not the way; you would
heal yourself of unbelief, and you ask remedies for it. Learn of
those who have been bound as you are, but who now stake
all that they possess; these are they who know the way you
would follow, who are cured of a disease of which you would be
cured. Follow the way by which they began, by making believe
that they believed, taking the holy water, having masses said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
etc. Thus you will naturally be brought to believe, and will lose
your acuteness.&mdash;But that is just what I fear.&mdash;Why? what have
you to lose?</p>

<p>But to show you that this is the right way, this it is that will
lessen the passions, which are your great obstacles, etc.&mdash;</p>

<p>What you say comforts and delights me, etc.&mdash;If my words
please you, and seem to you cogent, know that they are
those of one who has thrown himself on his knees before and
after to pray that Being, infinite, and without parts, to whom he
submits all his own being, that you also would submit to him all
yours, for your own good and for his glory, and that this strength
may be in accord with this weakness.</p>

<p><em>The end of this argument.</em>&mdash;Now what evil will happen to you
in taking this side? You will be trustworthy, honourable, humble,
grateful, generous, friendly, sincere, and true. In truth you will
no longer have those poisoned pleasures, glory and luxury, but you
will have other pleasures. I tell you that you will gain in this
life, at each step you make in this path you will see so much
certainty of gain, so much nothingness in what you stake, that
you will know at last that you have wagered on a certainty, an
infinity, for which you have risked nothing.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Objection.</em>&mdash;Those who hope for salvation are so far happy,
but they have as a counterpoise the fear of hell.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em>&mdash;Who has most reason to fear hell, the man who is in
ignorance if there be a hell, and who is certain of damnation if
there be; or he who is certainly convinced that there is a hell,
and has a hope of being saved if there be?</p>

<br />

<p>"I would soon have given up pleasure," say they, "had I but
faith." But I say to you, "you would soon have faith did you
leave off your pleasures. Now it is for you to begin. If I could,
I would give you faith. I cannot do this, nor discover therefore
if what you say is true. But you can easily give up pleasure,
and discover if what I say is true."</p>

<br />

<p><em>Probabilities.</em>&mdash;We must live differently in the world, according
to these different suppositions:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>1. That we could always remain in it. 2. That it is certain
we cannot remain here long, and uncertain if we shall remain
here an hour. This last supposition is the case with us.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Instability.</em>&mdash;It is horrible to feel all that we possess slipping
away from us.</p>

<br />

<p>By the law of probabilities you are bound to take pains to
seek the truth; for if you die without adoring the true source of
all things you are lost. "But," say you, "had he willed that I
should adore him, he would have left me tokens of his will."
He has done so, but you neglect them. Seek them then, it is
well worth your while.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Dungeon.</em>&mdash;I admit that it is not necessary to fathom the
opinion of Copernicus, but this:</p>

<p>It is all our life is worth to know if the soul be mortal or
immortal.</p>

<br />

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fascinatio nugacitatis.</i>&mdash;In order that passion may do no
hurt, we should act as though we had but a week to live.</p>

<p>If we ought to give a week we ought to give our whole life.</p>

<br />

<p>In short, what is it you promise me if not ten years of self-love
spent in trying hard to please without success, besides the
troubles which are certain? For ten years is the probability.</p>

<br />

<p>Let us imagine a number of men in chains, all condemned to
death, of whom some are strangled every day in the sight of
the others, while those who remain see their own condition in that
of their fellows, and wait their turn looking at each other sorrowfully
and without hope. This is an image of the lot of man.</p>

<br />

<p>We must know ourselves, and if that does not serve to discover
truth, it at least serves to regulate our lives, and there is
nothing more just.</p>

<br />

<p>There are but three classes of persons: those who having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
found God, serve him; those who not having found him, diligently
seek him; those who not having found him, live without
seeking him. The first are happy and wise, the last are unhappy
and fools, those between are unhappy, but they are wise.</p>

<br />

<p>It is certain that there is no good without the knowledge of
God, that only as we approach him are we happy, and that the
ultimate good is to know him certainly; that we are unhappy in
proportion as we are removed from him, and that the greatest
evil would be certainty of the opposite.</p>

<br />

<p>The ordinary world has the power of not thinking about what it
does not choose to think about. "Do not reflect on those passages
about the Messiah," said the Jew to his son. So our people often
act. Thus false religions are preserved, and the true also,
as regards many people.</p>

<p>But there are those who have not thus the power of preventing
thought, and who think the more the more we forbid
them. These get rid of false religions, and of the true also, if
they do not find solid reasons.</p>

<br />

<p>If we ought to do nothing save on a certainty, we ought to do
nothing for Religion, for this is not certain. But how much we do
on an uncertainty, as sea voyages, battles! I say then if this be
the case we ought to do nothing at all, for nothing is certain, and
that there is more certainty in Religion than that we shall see
another day, for it is not certain that we shall see to-morrow, but
it is certainly possible that we shall not see it. We cannot say
so much about Religion. It is not certain that it is, but who will
dare to say that it is certainly possible that it is not? But when
we work for to-morrow, therefore for the uncertain, we act
reasonably.</p>

<p>For we should work for the uncertain by the doctrine of
chances already laid down.</p>

<br />

<p>We know truth, not only by the reason, but also by the heart,
and it is from this last that we know first principles; and reason,
which has nothing to do with it, tries in vain to combat them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
The sceptics who desire truth alone labour in vain. We know
that we do not dream, although it is impossible to prove it by
reason, and this inability shows only the weakness of our reason,
and not, as they declare, the general uncertainty of our knowledge.
For our knowledge of first principles, as <em>space</em>, <em>time</em>, <em>motion</em>, <em>number</em>,
is as distinct as any principle derived from reason. And
reason must lean necessarily on this instinctive knowledge of the
heart, and must found on it every process. We know instinctively
that there are three dimensions in space, and that numbers are
infinite, and reason then shows that there are no two square
numbers one of which is double of the other. We feel principles,
we infer propositions, both with certainty, though by different
ways. It is as useless and absurd for reason to demand from
the heart proofs of first principles before it will admit them, as
it would be for the heart to ask from reason a feeling of all the
propositions demonstrated before accepting them.</p>

<p>This inability should serve then only to humiliate reason, which
would fain judge of all things, but not to shake our certainty, as
if only reason were able to instruct us. Would to God, on the
contrary, that we never needed reason, and that we knew every
thing by instinct and feeling! But nature has denied us this
advantage, and has on the contrary given us but little knowledge
of this kind, all the rest can be acquired by reason only.</p>

<p>Therefore those to whom God has given Religion by an
instinctive feeling, are very blessed, and justly convinced. But
to those who have it not we can give it only by reasoning,
waiting for the time when God shall impress it on their hearts,
without which faith is human only, and useless for salvation.</p>

<br />

<p>Those to whom God has given Religion by an instinctive
feeling are very blessed, and quite convinced. But as for
those who have it not, we can give it them only by reasoning,
waiting for the time when God himself shall impress it on their
heart, without which faith is useless for salvation.</p>

<br />

<p>Is then the soul too noble a subject for the feeble light
of man? Let us then abase the soul to matter, and see if she
knows whereof is made the very body which she animates, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
those others which she contemplates and moves at her will.
On this subject what have those great dogmatists known who
are ignorant of nothing?</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Harum sententiarum.</i></p>

<p>This would no doubt suffice if reason were reasonable. She is
reasonable enough to admit that she has never found anything
stable, but she does not yet despair of reaching it; on the
contrary, she is as ardent as ever in the search, and is sure that
she has in herself all the necessary powers for this conquest.</p>

<p>We must therefore make an end, and after having examined
these powers in their effects, recognise what they are in themselves,
and see if reason has power and grasp capable of seizing
the truth.</p>

<br />

<p>The Preacher shows that man without God is wholly ignorant,
and subject to inevitable misery. For to will and to be powerless
is to be miserable. Now he wills to be happy, and to be assured
of some truth, yet he can neither know, nor not desire to know.
He cannot even doubt.</p>

<br />

<p>This is what I see and what troubles me. I look on all sides,
and see nothing but obscurity, nature offers me nothing but
matter for doubt and disquiet. Did I see nothing there which
marked a Divinity I should decide not to believe in him. Did
I see every where the marks of a Creator, I should rest peacefully
in faith. But seeing too much to deny, and too little to affirm,
my state is pitiful, and I have a hundred times wished that if
God upheld nature, he would mark the fact unequivocally, but that
if the signs which she gives of a God are fallacious, she would
wholly suppress them, that she would either say all or say nothing,
that I might see what part I should take. Instead of this,
in my present state, ignorant of what I am, and of what I ought
to do, I know neither my condition nor my duty. My heart is
wholly bent to know where is the true good in order to follow it,
nothing would seem to me too costly for eternity.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>THE PHILOSOPHERS.</em></a></h3>
</div>

    <div>

<p class="noindent">The principal arguments of the sceptics&mdash;to omit those of less
importance&mdash;are that we have no certainty of the truth of these
principles apart from faith and revelation, save so far as we
naturally perceive them in ourselves. Now this natural perception
is no convincing evidence of their truth, since, having no
certainty apart from faith, whether man was created by a good
God, by an evil demon, or by chance, it may be doubted whether
these principles within us are true or false or uncertain according
to our origin.</p>

<p>And more than this: That no one has any certainty, apart
from faith, whether he wake or sleep, seeing that in sleep we
firmly believe we are awake, we believe that we see space, figure,
and motion, we are aware of the lapse and measure of time; in
a word we act as though we were awake. So that half of our life
being passed in sleep, we have by our own avowal, no idea of
truth, whatever we may suppose. Since then all our sentiments
are illusions, who can tell but that the other half of life wherein
we fancy ourselves awake be not another sleep somewhat different
from the former, from which we wake when we fancy ourselves
asleep?</p>

<p>And who doubts that if we dreamt in company, and if by
chance men's dreams agreed, which is common enough, and if
we were always alone when awake, we should believe that the
conditions were reversed? In a word, as we often dream that we
dream, and heap vision upon vision, it may well be that this life
itself is but a dream, on which the others are grafted, from
which we wake at death; having in our lifetime as few principles
of what is good and true, as during natural sleep, the different
thoughts which agitate us being perhaps only illusions like those
of the flight of time and the vain fantasies of our dreams....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>These are the principal arguments on one side and the other,
setting aside those of less importance, such as the talk of the
sceptics against the impressions of custom, education, manners,
climate, and the like; and these though they influence the
majority of ordinary men, who dogmatise only on vain foundations,
are upset by the least breath of the sceptics. We have
only to see their books if we are not convinced on this point,
and we shall soon become assured of it, perhaps only too much.</p>

<p>I pause at the only strong point of the dogmatists, namely,
that speaking sincerely and in good faith we cannot doubt of
natural principles.</p>

<p>Against this the sceptics set in one word the uncertainty of our
origin, which includes that of our nature. Which the dogmatists
have been trying to answer ever since the world began.</p>

<p>So then war is opened among men, in which each must take a
side, ranging himself either for dogmatism or for scepticism,
since neutrality, which is the part of the wise, is the oldest
dogma of the sceptical sect. Whoever thinks to remain neutral
is before all things a sceptic. This neutrality is the essence of
the sect; who is not against them is pre-eminently for them.
They are not for themselves, they are neutral, indifferent, in
suspense as to all things, themselves included.</p>

<p>What then shall man do in such a state? Shall he doubt of
all, doubt whether he wake, whether you pinch him, or burn him,
doubt whether he doubts, doubt whether he is? We cannot go
so far as that, and I therefore state as a fact that there never has
been a perfect finished sceptic; nature upholds the weakness of
reason, and prevents its wandering to such a point.</p>

<p>Shall he say on the contrary that he is in sure possession of
truth, when if we press him never so little, he can produce no
title, and is obliged to quit his hold?</p>

<p>What a chimæra then is man! how strange and monstrous!
a chaos, a contradiction, a prodigy. Judge of all things, yet a
weak earth-worm; depositary of truth, yet a cesspool of uncertainty
and error; the glory and offscouring of the Universe.</p>

<p>Who will unravel such a tangle? This is certainly beyond the
power of dogmatism and scepticism, and all human philosophy.
Man is incomprehensible by man. We grant to the sceptics<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
what they have so loudly asserted, that truth is not within our
reach nor to our taste, that her home is not on earth but in
heaven, that she dwells within the breast of God, and that we can
only know her so far as it pleases him to reveal her. Let us
then learn our true nature from truth uncreate and incarnate.</p>

<p>Nature confounds the sceptics, and reason the dogmatists.
What then will become of you, O men! who by your natural
reason search out your true condition? You can neither avoid
both these sects nor live in either.</p>

<p>Know then, proud man, how great a paradox thou art to
thyself. Bow down thyself, weak reason; be silent, thou foolish
nature; learn that man is altogether incomprehensible by man,
and learn from your master your true condition which you
ignore. Hear God.</p>

<p>For in a word, had man never been corrupt he would innocently
and securely enjoy truth and happiness. And had man
never been other than corrupt he would have no idea of virtue or
blessedness. But wretched as we are, and even more than if there
were no greatness in our condition, we have an idea of happiness
and cannot attain it, we feel an image of truth and possess a lie
only, alike incapable of absolute ignorance and of certain knowledge,
so manifest is it that we once were in a degree of perfection
from which we have unhappily fallen!</p>

<p>Yet it is an astonishing thing that the mystery most removed
from our knowledge, that of the transmission of sin, should be a
thing without which we can have no knowledge of ourselves.
For it is certain that nothing more shocks our reason than to
say that the sin of the first man rendered those culpable, who,
being so distant from the source, seem incapable of participation
in it. This transfusion does not only seem to us impossible, but
even most unjust, for there is nothing so repugnant to the rules
of our miserable justice as to damn eternally an infant incapable
of will, for a sin in which he seems to have so scanty a share,
that it was committed six thousand years before he was in being.
Certainly nothing shocks us more rudely than this doctrine, and
yet without this mystery, the most incomprehensible of all, we
are incomprehensible to ourselves. The tangle of our condition
takes its plies and folds in this abyss, so that man is more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
inconceivable without the mystery than the mystery is inconceivable
to man.</p>

<p>Whence it appears that God, willing to render the difficulty of
our being unintelligible to us, has concealed the knot so high,
or rather so low, that we cannot reach it; so that it is not by
the arrogant exertion of our reason, but by the simple submission
of reason, that we can truly know ourselves.</p>

<p>These foundations solidly established on the inviolable authority
of Religion make us understand that there are two truths
of faith equally constant&mdash;the one, that man in his state at
creation or in that of grace is elevated above the whole of nature,
made like unto God and sharer of his divinity&mdash;the other, that in
the state of corruption and sin he has fallen from his former state
and is made like unto the brutes. These two propositions are
equally fixed and certain. The Scripture declares this plainly
to us when it says in some places: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Deliciæ meæ esse cum filiis
hominum. Effundam spiritum meum super omnen carnem. Dii
estis, etc.;</i> and in other places, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Omnis caro fænum. Homo assimilatus
est jumentis insipientibus et similis factus est illis.
Dixi in corde meo de filiis hominum</i>.... Eccles. iii.</p>

<p>By which it clearly appears that man by grace is made like
unto God, and a sharer in his divinity, and that without grace
he is like the brute beasts, etc.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Scepticism.</em>&mdash;I shall here write my thoughts without order, yet
not perhaps in undesigned confusion, that is true order, which
will always denote my object by its very disorder.</p>

<p>I should do too much honour to my subject if I treated it with
order, because I wish to show that it is incapable of it.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Scepticism.</em>&mdash;All things here are true in part, and false in
part. Essential truth is not thus, it is altogether pure and true.
This mixture dishonours and annihilates it. Nothing is purely
true, and therefore nothing is true, understanding by that pure
truth. You will say it is true that homicide is an evil, yes, for
we know well what is evil and false. But what can be named
as good? Chastity? I say no, for then the world would come
to an end. Marriage? No, a celibate life is better. Not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
kill? No, for lawlessness would be horrible, and the wicked
would kill all the good. To kill then? No, for that destroys
nature. Goodness and truth are therefore only partial, and
mixed with what is evil and false.</p>

<br />

<p>Were we to dream the same thing every night, this would
affect us as much as the objects we see every day, and were an
artisan sure to dream every night, for twelve hours at a stretch,
that he was a king, I think he would be almost as happy as a
king who should dream every night for twelve hours at a stretch
that he was an artisan.</p>

<p>Should we dream every night that we were pursued by
enemies, and harassed by these painful phantoms, or that we were
passing all our days in various occupations, as in travelling, we
should suffer almost as much as if the dream were real, and
should fear to sleep, as now we fear to wake when we expect in
truth to enter on such misfortunes. And, in fact, it would bring
about nearly the same troubles as the reality.</p>

<p>But since dreams are all different, and each single dream is
diversified, what we see in them affects us much less than
what we see when awake, because that is continuous, not indeed
so continuous and level as never to change, but the change is
less abrupt, except occasionally, as when we travel, and then we
say, "I think I am dreaming," for life is but a little less inconstant
dream.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Instinct, reason.</em>&mdash;We have an incapacity of proof which no
dogmatism can overcome. We have an idea of truth, which no
scepticism can overcome.</p>

<br />

<p>Nothing more strengthens scepticism than that some are not
sceptics; were all so, they would be in the wrong.</p>

<br />

<p>This sect draw their strength from their enemies more than
from their friends, for the weakness of man appears much more
in those who are not, than in those who are conscious of it.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Against scepticism.</em>&mdash;We suppose that we all conceive of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
things in the same way, but it is a gratuitous supposition, of
which we have no proof. I see indeed that the same words are
applied on the same occasions, and that every time two men see
a body change its place, they both express their view of the same
object by the same word, both saying that it has moved, and from
this sameness of application we have a strong conviction of a
sameness of idea; but this, though it may be enough to justify
us in wagering the affirmative, is not finally or completely
convincing, since we know that we often draw the same conclusions
from different premisses.</p>

<p>This is enough, at any rate, to confuse the matter, not that
it wholly extinguishes the natural light which assures us of these
things; the academicians would have won, but this obscures it,
and troubles the dogmatists to the glory of the sceptical cabal,
which consists in this ambiguous ambiguity, and in a certain
doubtful haze, from which our doubts cannot take away all the
light, nor our natural light banish all the darkness.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Good sense.</em>&mdash;They are obliged to say, "You do not act in good
faith; we are not asleep," etc. How I like to see this proud reason
humiliated and suppliant. For this is not the language of a
man whose right is disputed, and who defends it with the mailed
power of his hand. He does not trifle by saying that men are
not acting in good faith, but he punishes this bad faith with
might.</p>

<br />

<p>It may be that there are true demonstrations, but it is not
certain. Thus this proves nothing but that it is not certain that
all is uncertain, to the glory of scepticism.</p>

<br />

<p>The falsity of those philosophers who do not discuss the immortality
of the soul. The falsity of their dilemma in Montaigne.</p>

<br />

<p>It is beyond doubt that the mortality or immortality of the
soul must make an entire difference in morals; yet philosophers
have treated morality independently of the question. They
discuss to pass the time.</p>

<p>Plato, to dispose towards Christianity.</p>

<br />

<p>The soul is immaterial. Philosophers have subdued their
passions. What matter could do that?</p>

<br />

<p>Atheists should say things which are perfectly clear, but it
is not perfectly clear that the soul is material.</p>

<br />

<p>Atheism is a mark of strength of mind, but only to a certain
degree.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Against those philosophers who believe in God without Jesus
Christ.</em>&mdash;They believe that God alone is worthy to be loved and
admired, and they have desired to be loved and admired of men,
and know not their own corruption. If they feel themselves full
of feelings of love and adoration, and if they find therein their
chief joy, let them think themselves good, and welcome! But if
they find themselves averse from him, if they have no inclination
but the wish to establish themselves in the esteem of men, and
if their whole perfection consists not in constraining, but yet in
causing men to find their happiness in loving them, I say that such
a perfection is horrible. What! they have known God, and have
not desired solely that men should love him, but that men should
stop short at loving them. They have wished to be the object
of the voluntary joy of men.</p>

<p>All the principles of sceptics, stoics, atheists, etc. are true; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
their conclusions are false, because the opposite principles are
also true.</p>

<br />

<p>But perhaps the subject goes beyond the reach of reason. We
will therefore examine what she has to say on questions within
her powers. If there be anything to which her own interest must
have made her apply herself most seriously, it is the search after
her sovereign good. Let us see then in what these strong and
clearsighted souls have placed it, and whether they agree.</p>

<p>One says that the sovereign good consists in virtue, another in
pleasure, another in the knowledge of nature, another in truth:
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas</i>, another in total ignorance,
another in indolence, others in neglect of appearances,
another in the lack of wonder, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nihil mirari prope res una quæ
possit facere et servare beatum</i>, the true sceptics in their indifference,
doubt and perpetual suspense, and others, more wise, think
they can find a better way. And this is all we get from them!</p>

<p>We must needs see if this fine philosophy has gained nothing
certain from a research so lengthy and so wide, at least perhaps
the soul has learned to know herself. We will hear the rulers
of the world on this matter. What have they thought of her
substance?</p>

<p>Have they been more happy in fixing her seat?</p>

<p>What have they discovered about her origin, duration and
departure?</p>

<br />

<p><em>Search for the true good.</em>&mdash;Ordinary men place their good in
fortune and external goods, or at least in amusement. Philosophers
have shown the vanity of all this, and have placed it where
best they could.</p>

<br />

<p>Philosophers reckon two hundred and eighty-eight sovereign
goods.</p>

<br />

<p><em>The sovereign good. Dispute about the sovereign good.</em>&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ut sis
contentus temetipso et ex te nascentibus bonis.</i> There is a
contradiction, for finally they advise suicide. Ah! happy life
indeed, from which we are to free ourselves as from the plague.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>It is well to be weary and harassed by the useless search after
the true good, that we may stretch our arms to the Redeemer.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Conversation.</em>&mdash;Great words: Religion. I deny it.</p>

<p><em>Conversation.</em>&mdash;Scepticism aids Religion.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Philosophers.</em>&mdash;We are full of matters which take us out of
ourselves.</p>

<p>Our instinct suggests that we must seek our happiness outside
ourselves; our passions hurry us abroad, even when there
are no objects to excite them. The objects outside us tempt
and call us, even when we do not think of them. And thus it is
in vain for philosophers to say, "Enter into yourselves, and you
will find your good there;" we believe them not, and those who
believe them are the most empty and the most foolish.</p>

<br />

<p>This civil war between reason and passion divides those who
desire peace into two sects, the one, of those who would renounce
their passions and become gods, the other, of those who
would renounce their reason and become brute beasts.&mdash;Des
Barreaux.&mdash;But neither has succeeded, and reason still exists, to
condemn the baseness and injustice of the passions, and to
trouble the repose of those who give themselves over to their
sway, and the passions are still vigorous in those who desire to
renounce them.</p>

<br />

<p><em>The Stoics.</em>&mdash;They conclude that what has been done once
may be done always, and that because the desire of glory gives
some degree of power to those possessed by it, others can easily
do the same.</p>

<p>These are the movements of fever, which health cannot imitate.</p>

<p>Epictetus concludes that since there are consistent Christians
all men can easily be so.</p>

<br />

<p>The three kinds of lust have made three sects, and philosophers
have done no other thing than follow one of the three
lusts.</p>

<br />

<p>What the Stoics propose is so difficult and so idle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>The Stoics lay down that all who are not at the highest degree
of wisdom are equally frivolous and vicious, as those who are in
two inches under water....</p>

<br />

<p><em>Philosophers.</em>&mdash;A fine thing to cry to a man who does not
know himself, that of himself he should come to God. And a
fine thing also to say to a man who knows himself.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>THOUGHTS ON MAHOMET AND ON
CHINA.</em></a></h3>
</div>

    <div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/p115.jpg" width="250" height="100" alt="Religions and their Ignorance of God" />
</div>

<p class="noindent"><em>The foundation of our faith.</em>&mdash;The heathen religion has no
foundation at the present day. We are told that it once had such
a foundation by the voice of the oracles, but what are the books
which certify this? Are they worthy of credence on account of
the virtue of their writers, have they been kept with such care
that we may feel certain none have tampered with them?</p>

<p>The Mahomedan religion has for its foundation the Koran
and Mahomet. But was this prophet, who was to be the last
hope of the world, foretold? What mark has he that every
other man has not who chooses to call himself prophet? What
miracles does he himself tell us that he wrought? What mystery
has he taught? Even according to his own tradition, what
was the morality, what the happiness he offered?</p>

<p>The Jewish religion must be differently regarded in the tradition
of the sacred books and in the tradition of the people. Its
morality and happiness are ridiculous in the tradition of the
people, but admirable in that of their saints. The foundation is
admirable, it is the most ancient book in the world, and the
most authentic, and whereas Mahomet, in order to ensure the
lasting existence of his book forbade men to read it, Moses with
the same object commanded everyone to read his. And it is the
same with all religions, for the Christianity of the sacred books
is quite different to that of the casuists.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>Our religion is so divine that another divine religion is only
the foundation of it.</p>

<br />

<p><em>The difference between Jesus Christ and Mahomet.</em>&mdash;Mahomet
was not foretold; Jesus Christ was foretold.</p>

<p>Mahomet that he slew; Jesus Christ that he caused his own
to be slain.</p>

<p>Mahomet forbade reading; the apostles ordered it.</p>

<br />

<p>In fact the two systems are so contrary that if Mahomet took
the way, humanly speaking, to succeed, Jesus Christ took,
humanly speaking, the way to perish. And instead of concluding
from Mahomet's success that Jesus Christ might well have
succeeded, we should rather say that since Mahomet succeeded,
Jesus Christ ought to have perished.</p>

<br />

<p>The Psalms are chanted throughout all the world.</p>

<p>Who renders testimony to Mahomet? Himself. Jesus Christ
wills that his testimony to himself should be of no avail.</p>

<p>The quality of witnesses demands that they should exist
always and everywhere, and the wretch stands alone.</p>

<br />

<p><em>The falsity of other religions.</em>&mdash;Mahomet had no authority.
His reasons ought to be most cogent, having nothing but their
own force.</p>

<p>What does he say then in order to make us believe him?</p>

<br />

<p>Any man can do what Mahomet did, for he wrought no
miracles, he was confirmed by no prophecies. No man can do
what Jesus Christ did.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Against Mahomet.</em>&mdash;The Koran is not more of Mahomet than
the Gospel is of Saint Matthew, for it is cited by many authors
from age to age. Even its very enemies, Celsus and Porphyry,
never disavowed it.</p>

<p>The Koran says that Saint Matthew was an honest man.
Therefore Mahomet was a false prophet for calling honest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
men wicked, or for not admitting what they have said of Jesus
Christ.</p>

<br />

<p>It is not by the obscurities in Mahomet which may be interpreted
in a mysterious sense, that I would have him judged,
but in what he speaks clearly, as of his paradise, and the rest,
he is ridiculous. And because what is clear is so absurd, it is
not just to take his obscurities for mysteries.</p>

<p>It is not the same with the Scripture. It may be admitted
that in it are obscurities as strange as those of Mahomet, but
much is admirably clear, and prophecies are manifestly fulfilled.
The cases are not the same. We must not confound and compare
things which only resemble each other in their obscurity,
and not in that clearness, which should induce us to reverence
the obscurities.</p>

<br />

<p>Suppose two persons tell foolish stories, one whose words
have a two-fold sense, understood only by his own followers, the
other which has only the one sense, a stranger not being in the
secret, who hears them both speak in this manner, would pass
on them a like judgment. But if afterwards in the rest of their
conversation one speak with the tongue of angels, and the other
mere wearisome common-places, he will judge that the one
spoke in mysteries and not the other; the one having sufficiently
shown that he was incapable of absurdity, and capable of being
mysterious, the other that he is incapable of mystery, and capable
of absurdity.</p>

<p>The Old Testament is a cipher.</p>

<br />

<p><em>History of China.</em>&mdash;I believe those histories only, whose witnesses
let themselves be slaughtered.</p>

<p>It is not a question of seeing this in bulk. I say there is in it
a something to blind and something to enlighten.</p>

<p>In this one word I destroy all your reasoning. "But China
obscures," you say, and I answer, "China obscures, but there is
light to be found; seek it."</p>

<p>Thus all that you say makes for one of these designs, and not at
all against the other. So this serves, and does no harm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>We must then look at this in detail, the papers must be laid
on the table.</p>

<br />

<p>Against the history of China, the historians of Mexico. The
five suns, of which the last is but eight hundred years old.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE.</em></a></h3>
</div>

    <div>

<p class="noindent">I see the Christian Religion founded on an earlier Religion, and
this is what I find of positive fact.</p>

<p>I do not here speak of the miracles of Moses, of Jesus Christ,
and of the Apostles, because they do not at first seem convincing,
and because I only wish here to adduce in evidence all those
foundations of the Christian Religion which are beyond a doubt,
and on which doubt cannot be cast by any person soever. It
is certain that we see in many places in the world a peculiar
people, separated from all other peoples of the world, which is
called the Jewish people.</p>

<p>I see then a mass of religions in many countries, and in all
times, but they neither please me by their morality, nor convince
me by their proofs. Thus I should equally have refused the religion
of Mahomet and of China, of the ancient Romans and of the
Egyptians, for the sole reason, that none having more marks of
truth than another, nor any thing which necessarily decides me,
reason cannot incline to one rather than the other.</p>

<p>But while I consider this vacillating and strange variety of
morals and beliefs at different times, I find in one corner of the
world a peculiar people, separated from all other nations upon
earth, the oldest of all, and whose histories are earlier by many
ages than the most ancient in our possession.</p>

<p>I find then this great and numerous people, sprung from a single
man, who adore one God, and guide themselves by a law, given
them as they say, by his own hand. They maintain that to them
alone in the world God has revealed his mysteries, that all men
are corrupt and under the wrath of God, are all abandoned to
their senses and imagination, whence arise the strange errors
and continual changes among them, both of religions and of
manners, whereas this nation remains unshaken in its conduct:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
but that God will not leave other nations in darkness for ever,
that there will come a Saviour for all, that they are in the world
to announce his coming, that they were expressly formed to be
the forerunners and heralds of this great advent, and to call on
all nations to join with them in the expectation of this Redeemer.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Advantages of the Jewish people.</em>&mdash;In this search the Jewish
people at first attracts my attention by a number of wonderful
and singular things which appear among them.</p>

<p>I see first that they are a people wholly composed of brethren,
and whereas all others are formed by the assemblage of an
infinity of families, this, though so prodigiously fruitful, has
sprung from one man only, and being thus all one flesh, and
members one of another, they form a powerful state consisting of
one family, a fact without example.</p>

<p>This family or nation is the most ancient known to men, a fact
which seems to invest it with a peculiar veneration, especially in
regard to our present enquiry, because if God has during all time
revealed himself to men, these are they from whom we must learn
the tradition.</p>

<p>This people is not peculiar only by their antiquity, but also
remarkable by their duration, which has been unbroken from
their origin till now. For while the nations of Greece and Italy,
of Lacedæmon, Athens and Rome, and others who came after,
have long been extinct, these still remain, and in spite of the
endeavours of many powerful princes who have a hundred times
striven to destroy them, as their historians testify, and as we can
easily understand by the natural order of things during so long a
space of years, they have nevertheless been preserved, and
extending from the earliest times to the latest, their history
comprehends in its duration all our histories.</p>

<p>The Law by which this people is governed is at once the
most ancient law in the world, the most perfect, and the only
one which has been kept without interruption in a state. This
is what Josephus excellently shows, against Apion, as does Philo
the Jew in many places, where they point out that it is so ancient
that the very name of <em>law</em> was only known by the men of old
more than a thousand years afterwards, so that Homer, who has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
treated the history of so many States, has not once used the word.
And it is easy to judge of the perfection of the Law by simply
reading it, for it plainly provides for all things with so great
wisdom, equity and judgment, that the most ancient legislators,
Greek and Roman, having had some glimpse of it, have borrowed
from it their principal laws, as appears by those called Of the
Twelve Tables, and by the other proofs given by Josephus.</p>

<p>Yet this law is at the same time severe and rigorous beyond
all others in respect to their religious worship, constraining the
people, in order to keep them in their duty, to a thousand peculiar
and painful observances, on pain of death. Whence it is a
most astonishing fact, that it has been constantly preserved
during many ages by a people so rebellious and impatient, while
all other states have changed their laws from time to time,
although they are far more lenient.</p>

<p>The book containing this law, the first of all laws, is itself the
most ancient book in the world, those of Homer, Hesiod and
others dating from six or seven hundred years later.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Falsity of other religions.</em>&mdash;They have no witnesses; this people
has them. God challenges other religions to produce such
marks. Is. xliii. 9,&mdash;xliv. 8.</p>

<br />

<p>This is fact. While all philosophers separate into different
sects, there is found in one corner of the world, a people,
the most ancient in the world, declaring that all the world
is in error, that God has revealed to them the truth, that they
will abide always on the earth. In fact, all other sects come to an
end, this one still endures, and has done so for four thousand
years. They assert that they hold from their ancestors that man
has fallen from communion with God, is entirely separated from
God, but that he has promised to redeem them, that their doctrine
shall always exist on the earth;</p>

<p>That their law has a twofold sense, that during sixteen hundred
years they have had people whom they believed prophets foretelling
both the time and the manner;</p>

<p>That four hundred years after they were scattered everywhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
in order that Jesus Christ should be everywhere announced, Jesus
Christ came in the manner and time foretold;</p>

<p>That the Jews have since been scattered abroad under a curse,
yet nevertheless still exist.</p>

<br />

<p>The creation and the deluge being past, and God not
intending any more to destroy the world, nor to create it anew,
nor to give any such great proofs of himself, he began to
establish a people on the earth, formed of set purpose, which
should last until the coming of that people whom Messiah
should mould by his spirit.</p>

<br />

<p>The Jews who were called to subdue the nations and their
kings were slaves of sin, and the Christians whose calling has
been to be servants and subjects, are free children.</p>

<br />

<p>The devil troubled the zeal of the Jews before Jesus Christ,
because he would have been their salvation, but not since.</p>

<p>The Jewish people mocked of the Gentiles, the Christian
people persecuted.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Republic.</em>&mdash;The Christian and even the Jewish Republic has
only had God for master, as Philo the Jew notices, <cite>On
Monarchy</cite>.</p>

<p>When they fought, they did so for God alone, their chief hope
was in God alone, they considered their towns as belonging to
God, and they kept them for God. I Chron. xix. 13.</p>

<br />

<p>The sceptre was not interrupted by the carrying away into
Babylon, because the return was promised and foretold.</p>

<br />

<p>A single phrase of David or of Moses, as for instance that
God will circumcise the heart, enables us to judge of their spirit.
If all the rest of their language were ambiguous, and left it
doubtful whether they were philosophers or Christians, one single
sentence of this kind would determine all the rest, as one
sentence of Epictetus determines the character of the rest to be
the contrary. So far we may be in doubt, but not afterwards.</p>

<br />

<p>While the prophets were for maintaining the law, the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber Note: Original text 'people was'">people were</ins>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
negligent, but since there have been no more prophets, zeal
has taken their place.</p>

<p>The zeal of the Jewish people for the law, especially since there
have been no more prophets.</p>

<br />

<p>Maccabees after they had no more prophets. The Masorah
after Jesus Christ.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE SACRED
BOOKS.</em></a></h3>
</div>

    <div>

<p class="noindent"><em>The Premiss.</em>&mdash;Moses was a man of genius. If then he ruled
himself by his reason, he should say nothing clearly which was
directly against reason.</p>

<p>So all the apparent weaknesses are strength. Example: the
two genealogies in Saint Matthew and Saint Luke. What can
be more clear than that this was not concerted?</p>

<br />

<p><em>Proof of Moses.</em>&mdash;Why should Moses make the lives of men
so long, and their generations so few?</p>

<p>Because it is not the length of years, but the number of
generations which renders matters obscure.</p>

<p>For truth is impaired only by the change of men. And yet
Moses places two things, the most memorable that can be
imagined, that is to say the creation and the deluge, so near that
we can reach from one to the other.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Another proof.</em>&mdash;The longevity of the patriarchs, instead of
causing the loss of past history, was the rather serviceable for
its preservation. For if we are not always well instructed in the
history of our ancestors, it is because we have never lived much
with them, and because they are often dead before we have
ourselves attained the age of reason. But when men lived so
long, children lived long with their parents, and long conversed
with them. Now, their conversation could only be of the
history of their ancestors, since to that all history was reduced,
and men did not study science or art, which now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
take up so much of our daily discourse. We see also that
at that time men took special care to preserve their genealogies.</p>

<br />

<p>Shem, who saw Lamech, who saw Adam, saw also Jacob, who
saw those who saw Moses; therefore the deluge and the
creation are true. This is conclusive among certain people who
clearly understand it.</p>

<br />

<p>Josephus conceals the shame of his nation.</p>

<p>Moses does not conceal his own shame nor....</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quis mihi det ut omnes prophetent?</i></p>

<p>He was tired of the people.</p>

<br />

<p>When the creation of the people began to stand at a distance,
God provided a single contemporary historian, and appointed a
whole people as the guardians of this book, in order that the
history might be the most authentic in all the world, that all
men might learn a thing so necessary to know, yet so impossible
to be known in any other way.</p>

<br />

<p>If the story in Esdras is credible, then it must be believed that
Scripture is Holy Scripture. For this story is founded only on
the authority of those who allege that of the Seventy, which
shows that the Scripture is holy.</p>

<p>Therefore if the tale be true, we find our proof therein, if not
we have it elsewhere. Thus those who would ruin the truth of
our Religion, founded on Moses, establish it by the same
authority by which they attack it. Thus by this providence it
still exists.</p>

<br />

<p><em>On Esdras.</em>&mdash;The story that the books were burnt with the
temple shown to be false by The Book of Maccabees. <em>Jeremiah
gave them the law.</em></p>

<p>The story that he recited the whole by heart. Josephus and
Esdras note <em>that he read the book</em>. Baronius, Ann. 180. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nullus
penitus Hebræorum antiquorum reperitur qui tradiderit libros

<p>Josephus says the Law was in Hebrew when it was translated
by the Seventy.</p>

<p>Under Antiochus and Vespasian, when they wished to abolish
the books, and when there was no prophet, they could not do so.
And under the Babylonians when there had been no persecution,
and when there were so many prophets, would they have allowed
them to be burnt?</p>

<p>Josephus derides the Greeks who would not allow....</p>

<p><em>Against the Story in Esdras</em>, II. Maccab. 2. Josephus, <cite>Antiquities</cite>,
II. 1.&mdash;Cyrus took occasion from the prophecy of Isaiah
to release the people. The Jews held property in peace under
Cyrus in Babylon, therefore they might well have the Law.</p>

<p>Josephus, in the whole history of Esdras, says not a single word
of this restoration.&mdash;II. Kings, xvii. 37.</p>

<br />

<p>Scripture has provided passages of consolation and warning
for every condition of life.</p>

<p>Nature seems to have done the same thing by her two infinities,
natural and moral, for we shall always have those who are
higher and lower, who are more and less able, who are noble and
in low estate, in order to abate our pride, and raise our lowliness.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Order, against the objection that the Scripture has no order.</em>&mdash;The
heart has its own order; the mind too has its own,
which is by premisses and demonstrations, that of the heart is
wholly different. It were absurd to prove that we are worthy of
love by putting forth in order the causes of love.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ and Saint Paul use the order of charity, not of the
intellect, for they wish to warm, not to teach; the same with Saint
Augustine. This order consists mainly in digressions on each
point which may illustrate the main end, and keep it ever in view.</p>

<br />

<p>God and the Apostles foreseeing that the seed of pride would
cause heresies to spring up, and not wishing to give them occasion
to arise by defining them, have placed in the Scripture and
the prayers of the Church contrary words and sentences to
produce their fruit in time.</p>

<p>So in morals he gives charity to produce fruits contrary to lust.</p>

<p>He who knows the will of his master will be beaten with more
stripes, because of the power he has by his knowledge. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Qui
justus est justificetur adhuc</i>, because of the power which he has
by justice. From him who has received most will the greatest
account be demanded, because the aid received has given him
greater power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>There is an universal and essential difference between the
actions of the will and all other actions.</p>

<p>The will is one of the chief organs of belief, not that it forms
belief, but that things are true or false according to the side on
which we view them. The will which chooses one side rather
than the other turns away the mind from considering the
qualities of all that it does not like to see, thus the mind, moving
in accord with the will, stays to look at the side it chooses,
and so judges by what it sees.</p>

<br />

<p>All things work together for good to the elect, even the obscurities
of Scripture, which they honour because of what is divinely
clear. And all things work together for evil to the reprobate,
even what is clear, which they blaspheme because of the
obscurities they do not understand.</p>

<br />

<p>How many stars have telescopes discovered for us which did
not exist for the philosophers of old. Men have roundly taken
holy Scripture to task in regard to the great multitude of stars,
saying: "We know that there are only a thousand and twenty-two."</p>

<br />

<p>The meaning changes according to the words which express
it. The meaning receives its dignity from words instead of
giving it. We must seek examples of this.</p>

<br />

<p>Words differently arranged have different meanings, and
meanings differently arranged produce different effects.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>THE PROPHECIES.</em></a></h3>
</div>

    <div>

<p class="noindent">The prophecies are the strongest proofs of Jesus Christ.
For these therefore God has made the most provision; since the
event which has fulfilled them is a miracle existing from the
birth of the Church to the end. Therefore God raised up prophets
during sixteen hundred years, and during four hundred
years afterwards he dispersed all these prophecies with all
the Jews, who bore them into all regions of the world. Such
was the preparation for the birth of Jesus Christ, whose Gospel
exacting belief from every man made it necessary not only that
there should be prophecies to inspire this belief, but that these
prophecies should be spread throughout the whole world, so
that the whole world should embrace it.</p>

<p><em>Prophecies.</em>&mdash;If one man alone had made a book of predictions
concerning Jesus Christ, both as to the time and the manner of
his coming, and if Jesus Christ had come in agreement with
these prophecies, the fact would have had infinite force.</p>

<p>But in this case there is much more. Here is a succession of
men for the space of four thousand years, who without interruption
or variation, follow one another in foretelling the same
event. Here is a whole people announcing it, existing for
four thousand years, to testify in a body their certainty, from
which they cannot be diverted by all the threatenings and persecutions
brought to bear against them; this is in a far greater
degree important.</p>

<br />

<p>But it was not enough that the prophecies existed, they needed
also distribution through all places, and preservation through all
time. And in order that this agreement might not be taken as
an effect of chance, it was necessary it should be foretold.</p>

<p>It is much more glorious for the Messiah that they should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
spectators and even instruments of his glory, beyond the fact
that God had preserved him.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Proof.</em>&mdash;Prophecy with accomplishment.</p>

<p>That which preceded, and that which followed Jesus Christ.</p>

<br />

<p>The prophecies concerning the Messiah are mingled with
some concerning other matters, so that neither the prophecies
of the Messiah should be without proof, nor the special prophecies
without fruit.</p>

<br />

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non habemus regem nisi Cæsarem.</i> Therefore Jesus Christ
was the Messiah, because they had no longer any king but a
stranger, and because they would have no other.</p>

<br />

<p>The eternal kingdom of the race of David, II. Chron., by all
the prophecies, and with an oath. And it was not temporally
accomplished. Jer. xxxiii. 20.</p>

<br />

<p>Zeph. iii. 9.&mdash;"I will give my words to the Gentiles, that all
may serve me with one consent."</p>

<p>Ezekiel xxxvii 25.&mdash;"My servant David shall be their prince
for ever."</p>

<p>Exodus iv. 22.&mdash;"Israel is my first born."</p>

<br />

<p>We might easily think that when the prophets foretold that
the sceptre would not depart from Judah until the advent of the
eternal king, they spoke to flatter the people, and that their
prophecy was proved false by Herod. But to show that this was
not their meaning, and that on the contrary they well knew that
the temporal kingdom should cease, they said they would be without
a king, and without a prince, and for a long time. Hosea iii. 4.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Prophecies.</em>&mdash;That Jesus Christ will sit on the right hand till
God has put his enemies under his feet.</p>

<p>Therefore he will not subject them himself.</p>

<br />

<p>The time of the first advent was foretold, the time of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
second is not so, because the first was to be secret, the second
must be glorious, and so manifest that even his enemies will recognise
it. But as his first coming was to be obscure, and to be
known only of those who searched the Scriptures....</p>

<br />

<p>The prophecies must be unintelligible to the wicked, Daniel
xii. 10, Hosea xiv. 9, but intelligible to those who are well
instructed.</p>

<p>The prophecies which represent him poor, represent him
master of the nations.&mdash;Is. lii. 16, etc liii. Zech. ix. 9.</p>

<p>The prophecies which foretell the time foretell him only as
master of the Gentiles and suffering, and not as in the clouds
nor as judge. And those which represent him thus as judge
and in glory do not specify the time.</p>

<br />

<p>Do you think that the prophecies cited in the Gospel were
reported to make you believe? No, but to prevent your
believing.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Prophecies.</em>&mdash;The time was foretold by the state of the Jewish
people, by the state of the heathen world, by the state of the
temple, by the number of years.</p>

<p>It is daring to predict the same affair in so many ways.
It was necessary that the four idolatrous or pagan monarchies,
the end of the kingdom of Judah, and the seventy weeks should
coincide, and all this before the second temple was destroyed.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Prophecies.</em>&mdash;The seventy weeks of Daniel are equivocal in
the term of commencement, because of the terms of the prophecy,
and in the term of conclusion because of the differences in the
chronologists. But all this difference extends only to two
hundred years.</p>

<br />

<p>We understand the prophecies only when we see the events
occur, thus the proofs of retreat, discretion, silence, etc., are
evidence only to those who know and believe them.</p>

<p>Joseph so interior in a law so exterior.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>Exterior penances dispose to interior, as humiliations to
humility. So the....</p>

<br />

<p>The more I examine them the more I find truths in them,
both in those which preceded and those which followed, both
the synagogue which was foretold, and the wretches who adhere
to it, and who, being our enemies, are admirable witnesses of the
truth of these prophecies, wherein their misery and even their
blindness is foretold.</p>

<p>I find this sequence, our Religion wholly divine in its authority,
in its duration, in its perpetuity, in its morality, in its conduct, its
doctrine, and its effects.</p>

<p>The frightful darkness of the Jews foretold. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eris palpans in
meridie. Dabitur liber scienti literas, et dicet: Non possum
legere.</i></p>

<br />

<p>Hosea i. 9. "Ye shall not be my people and I will not be your
God," when you are multiplied after the dispersion. "In the places
where it was said: Ye are not my people, I will call them my
people."</p>

<br />

<p><em>Predictions.</em>&mdash;That under the fourth monarchy, before the
destruction of the second temple, before the dominion of the
Jews was taken away, and in the seventieth week of Daniel,
while the second temple was still standing, the Gentiles should
be instructed, and brought to the knowledge of the God worshipped
by the Jews, that those who loved him should be
delivered from their enemies, and filled with his fear and love.</p>

<p>And it came to pass that under the fourth monarchy, before
the destruction of the second temple, etc, the Gentiles in crowds
worshipped God and lived an angelic life. Maidens dedicated
their virginity and their life to God, men gave up their pleasures,
what Plato was only able to effect upon a few men, chosen and
instructed to that end, a secret force, by the power of a few
words, now wrought upon a hundred million ignorant men.</p>

<p>The rich left their wealth, children left the luxurious homes of
their parents to go into the austerity of the desert, etc., according
to Philo the Jew. All this was foretold long ages ago. For two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
thousand years no Gentile had worshipped the God of the Jews,
and at the time foretold, the crowd of Gentiles worshipped this
only God. The temples were destroyed, the very kings bowed
themselves under the cross. All this was of the Spirit of God
spread abroad upon the earth.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Holiness.</em>&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Effundam spiritum meum.</i>&mdash;All nations had been
in unbelief and lust; the whole world was now ablaze with love.
Princes quitted their state, maidens suffered martyrdom. This
power sprang from the advent of Messiah, this was the effect and
these the tokens of his coming.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Predictions.</em>&mdash;It was foretold that in the time of Messiah he
would come and establish a new covenant, such as should make
them forget the coming out from Egypt, Jer. xxiii. 5, Is. xliii.
16, that he would put his Law not in externals, but in the heart,
that Jesus Christ would put his fear, which had been only from
without, in the midst of the heart. Who does not see the
Christian law in all this?</p>

<br />

<p><em>Prophecies.</em>&mdash;That the Jews would reject Jesus Christ, and
would themselves be rejected of God because the choice vine
brought forth only wild grapes; that the chosen people should
be disloyal, ungrateful, incredulous, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">populum non credentem et
contradicentem</i>; that God would strike them with blindness,
and that in full mid-day they would grope like blind men; that
his messenger should go before him.</p>

<br />

<p>"... Then shall a man no more teach his neighbour, saying,
There is the Lord, <em>for God will make himself felt by all, your
sons shall prophesy</em>. <em>I will put my spirit and my fear in your
heart.</em>"</p>

<p>All that is the same thing. To prophesy is to speak of God,
not by outward proofs, but by a feeling interior and direct.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Prophecies.</em>&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Transfixerunt</i>, Zech. xii. 10.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>That there should come a deliverer to crush the demon's head,
and to free his people from their sins, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex omnibus iniquitatibus</i>.
That there should be a new and eternal covenant, and a new
and eternal priesthood after the order of Melchisedek, that the
Christ should be glorious, powerful, mighty, and yet so miserable
that he would not be recognised, nor taken for what he is, but be
rejected and slain, that his people which denied him should be
no more his people, that the idolaters would receive him and trust
in him, that he would quit Zion to reign in the centre of idolatry,
that the Jews should exist for ever, that he would spring from
Judah, and at a time when there should be no longer a king.</p>

<br />

<p>That Jesus Christ would be small in his beginnings, and afterwards
would increase. The little stone of Daniel.</p>

<br />

<p>That he would teach men the perfect way,</p>

<p>And never has there come before him nor after him any man
who has taught anything divine approaching this.</p>

<br />

<p>That then idolatry would be overthrown, that the Messiah
would cast down all idols, and would bring men into the worship
of the true God.</p>

<p>That the idol temples would be overthrown, and that among all
nations and in all places of the world men would offer to God a
pure sacrifice, not of beasts.</p>

<p>That he would be king of the Jews and Gentiles. And we see
this king of Jews and Gentiles oppressed by both, both equally
conspiring his death, we see him bear rule over both, destroying
the worship established by Moses in Jerusalem its centre, where
he placed his earliest Church, as well as the worship of idols in
Rome its centre, where he placed his chief Church.</p>

<br />

<p>No Gentile from Moses to Jesus Christ according to the
Rabbis themselves. The crowd of the Gentiles after Jesus Christ
believed in the books of Moses and observed their essence and
spirit, casting away only what was useless.</p>

<p>Moses first taught the Trinity, original sin, the Messiah.</p>

<p>David was a great witness.</p>

<p>A king, good, merciful, a fair soul, a fine mind, powerful. He
prophesied, and his wonders came to pass. This is infinite.</p>

<p>He had only to say that he was the Messiah, had he been
vain enough, for the prophecies are clearer about him than
about Jesus Christ. The same with Saint John.</p>

<p><em>Special predictions.</em>&mdash;They were strangers in Egypt without
any private possessions, in that country or in any other, when
Jacob dying and blessing his twelve children declared to them
that they should possess a great land, and foretold in particular
to the family of Judah that the kings who would one day
govern them should be of his race, and that all his brethren
should be subject to him.</p>

<p>This same Jacob disposing of the future land as though he
were its master, gave a portion to Joseph more than to the
others. "I give thee," said he, "a portion more than to thy
brethren." And blessing his two children, Ephraim and Manasseh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
whom Joseph had presented to him, the elder, Manasseh,
on his right, and the young Ephraim on his left, he put his
arms cross-wise, and placing his right hand on the head of
Ephraim, and the left on Manasseh, he blessed them thus. And
when Joseph represented to him that he was preferring the
younger he answered him with admirable decision, "I know
it well, my son, I know it, but Ephraim shall increase in a
way quite other than Manasseh." This has been in fact so true
in the result that, being alone almost as abundant as the two
entire lines which compose a whole kingdom, they have been
usually called by the name of Ephraim alone.</p>

<p>This same Joseph when dying commanded his children to
bear his bones with them into that land to which they did not
come for two hundred years afterwards.</p>

<p>Moses, who wrote all these things so long before they happened,
himself made for each family the partition of the land
before they entered it, as though he had been master of it.</p>

<p>He gave them judges to divide it, he prescribed the entire
political form of government which they should observe, the
cities of refuge which they should build, and....</p>

<p>Daniel ii. "All thy sooth-sayers and wise men cannot show
unto thee the secret which thou hast demanded.</p>

<p>"But there is a God in heaven, who can do so, and he has
revealed in thy dream the things which shall be in the latter
days." <em>This dream must have caused him great uneasiness.</em></p>

<p>"And it is not by my own wisdom that I have knowledge
of this secret, but by the revelation of this same God who has
discovered it to me, to make it manifest in thy presence.</p>

<p>"Thy dream was of this kind. Thou sawest a great image,
high and terrible, which stood before thee. His head was of
gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs
of brass. His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.</p>

<p>"Thus thou sawest till a stone was cut out without hands,
which smote the image upon his feet, that were of iron and clay
and brake them to pieces.</p>

<p>"Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold,
broken to pieces together, and the wind carried them away, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
this stone which smote the image became a great mountain, and
filled the whole earth. This is the dream, and now I will give
thee the interpretation.</p>

<p>"Thou who art the greatest of kings, and to whom God has
given a power so extended that thou art renowned among all
people, art the golden head of the image which thou hast seen.</p>

<p>"But after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee,
and another of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.</p>

<p>"But the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron, and even as
iron breaketh in pieces, and subdueth all things, so this empire
shall break in pieces and bruise.</p>

<p>"And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of clay and
part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; and it shall be partly
strong and partly broken.</p>

<p>"But as iron cannot be firmly mixed with clay, so they who are
represented by the iron and by the clay, cannot cleave one to
another though united by marriage.</p>

<p>"Now in the days of these kings will God raise up a Kingdom,
which shall never be destroyed, nor ever be delivered up to
another people.</p>

<p>"It shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and
it shall stand for ever, according as thou sawest that the stone
was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it fell from
the mountain, and brake in pieces the iron, the clay, the silver
and the gold. This is what God has revealed to thee of the things
which must come in the fulness of time. This dream is true
and the interpretation thereof is faithful. Then Nebuchadnezzar
fell upon his face towards the earth, etc."</p>

<p>Daniel viii. "Daniel having seen the combat of the ram and
of the he-goat, who vanquished him and ruled over the earth,
whereof the principal horn being broken four others came up
towards the four winds of heaven, and out of one of them came
forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great toward the South
and toward the East, and toward the land of Israel, and it waxed
great, even to the host of heaven, and it cast down some of the
stars, and stamped upon them, and at last overthrew the prince,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away and the place of
his sanctuary was cast down.</p>

<p>"This is what Daniel saw. He asked the explanation and a
voice cried in this manner, 'Gabriel, make this man to understand
the vision.' And Gabriel said,</p>

<p>"The ram which thou sawest is the king of the Medes and
Persians, and the he-goat is the king of Greece, and the great horn
that is between his eyes is the first king of this monarchy.</p>

<p>"Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four
kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not with his
strength.</p>

<p>"Now in the latter time of their kingdom when iniquities
shall be grown up, there shall arise a king insolent and strong,
but his power shall be not his own. To him all things shall
succeed after his will, and he shall destroy the holy people, and
through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his
hand, and he shall destroy many. He shall also stand up against
the Prince of Princes, but he shall perish miserably, and nevertheless
by a violent hand."</p>

<p>Daniel ix. 20.</p>

<p>"As I was praying God with all my heart, and confessing
my sin and the sin of all my people, and prostrating myself
before God, even Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at
the beginning, came to me and touched me about the time of
the evening oblation, and he informed me and said, O Daniel, I
am now come forth to teach thee that thou mightest understand.
At the beginning of thy prayer I came to show thee that which thou
didst desire, for thou art greatly beloved: therefore understand
the matter and consider the vision. Seventy weeks are determined
upon thy people, and upon thy holy city, to finish the
transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to abolish iniquity
and to bring in everlasting righteousness; to accomplish the
vision and the prophecies, and to anoint the Most Holy.</p>

<p>"After which this people shall be no more thy people, nor this
city the holy city. The times of wrath are passed and the years
of grace shall come for ever.</p>

<p>"Know therefore, and understand, that from the going forth
of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Messiah the Prince, shall be seven weeks, and three score and
two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in
troublous times."</p>

<p>The Hebrews were accustomed to divide numbers, and to
place the smaller first, so that seven and sixty-two make sixty-nine.
Of this seventy there will then rest the seventieth: that is
to say the seven last years of which he will speak next, and after
these sixty-two weeks which have followed the seven first, the
Christ should be killed, and a people would come with its
prince, who should destroy the city, and the sanctuary, and overwhelm
all, and the end of that war will accomplish the desolation.
Christ shall be killed after the sixty-nine weeks, that is to
say, in the last week.</p>

<p>"Now one week, which is the seventieth, which remains, shall
confirm the covenant with many, and in the midst of the week,
that is to say the last three years and a half, he shall cause the
sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of
abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation,
and that determined shall be poured upon the
desolate."</p>

<p>Daniel xi. The angel said to Daniel:</p>

<p>"There shall stand up yet,"&mdash;after Cyrus, under whom all this
still is,&mdash;"three kings in Persia,"&mdash;Cambyses, Smyrdis, Darius;&mdash;"and
the fourth,"&mdash;Xerxes, who shall then come,&mdash;"shall be far
richer than they all, and far stronger, and shall stir up all his
people against the Greeks, and a mighty king shall stand up,"&mdash;Alexander,&mdash;"that
shall rule with great dominion, and do according
to his will. And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall
be broken, and shall be divided in four parts toward the four
winds of heaven,"&mdash;see also vii. 6 vii. 8&mdash;"but not to his posterity,
and his successors shall not equal his power, for his kingdom
shall be plucked up, even for others beside these,"&mdash;his four
principal successors.</p>

<p>"And the king&mdash;Ptolemy son of Lagos,&mdash;of the south,"&mdash;Egypt,&mdash;"shall
be strong,&mdash;but one of his princes shall be strong
above him,"&mdash;Seleucus king of Syria,&mdash;"and his dominion shall be
a great dominion,"&mdash;Appian says that he was the most powerful
of Alexander's successors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>"And in the end of years they shall join themselves together,
and the king's daughter of the South,"&mdash;Berenice, daughter
of Ptolemy Philadelphus, son of the other Ptolemy&mdash;"shall come
to the king of the North to make peace between these princes"&mdash;to
Antiochus Deus, king of Syria and of Asia, son of Seleucus
Lagidas.</p>

<p>"But neither she nor her seed shall have a long authority,
for she and they that sent her and they that brought her, and
her children and her friends, shall be delivered to death,"&mdash;Berenice
and her son were killed by Seleucus Callinicus.</p>

<p>"But out of a branch of her roots"&mdash;Ptolemy Euergetes was
the son of the same father as Berenice&mdash;"shall one stand up in
his estate, who shall come with an army into the land of the king
of the north, and shall put all under subjection, and carry
captives into Egypt their gods, their princes, their gold, their
silver, and all their precious spoils, and shall continue many
years when the king of the North can do nought against him."&mdash;If
he had not been called into Egypt by domestic reasons,
says Justin, he would have entirely ruined Seleucus.</p>

<p>"And thus he shall return into his kingdom, but his sons shall
be stirred up and shall prepare an exceeding great multitude"&mdash;Seleucus
Ceraunus, Antiochus the Great.</p>

<p>"And their army shall come and overthrow all, whereat the
king of the South being moved with choler, shall come forth
and fight with him and conquer,"&mdash;Ptolemy Philopator against
Antiochus the Great at Raphia&mdash;"and his troops shall become
insolent, and his heart shall be lifted up,"&mdash;this Ptolemy desecrated
the temple&mdash;Josephus&mdash;"and he shall cast down many ten
thousands, but he shall not be strengthened by it.</p>

<p>"For the king of the North"&mdash;Antiochus the Great&mdash;"shall
return with a greater multitude than before,"&mdash;in the reign of
the young Ptolemy Epiphanes&mdash;"and then a great number of
enemies shall stand up against the king of the south, also the
apostates and robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to
establish the vision; but they shall perish"&mdash;those who abandon
their religion to please Euergetes, when he will send his troops
to Scopas. For Antiochus will again take Scopas and conquer
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>"And the king of the North shall destroy the fenced cities and
the armies of the south shall not withstand, and all shall yield to
his will. He shall stand in the land of Israel and it shall yield
to him.</p>

<p>"And thus he will think to render himself master of all the empire
of Egypt,"&mdash;despising the youth of Epiphanes, says Justin.</p>

<p>"And for that he will make alliance with him and give his
daughter,"&mdash;Cleopatra, in order that she may betray her husband.
On which Appian says that doubtful of being able to make himself
master of Egypt by force, because of the protection of the
Romans, he wished to attempt it by craft. "He would fain corrupt
her, but she shall not stand on his side, neither be for him.
After this shall he turn his face unto the isles,"&mdash;that is to say,
the sea-ports,&mdash;"and shall take many,"&mdash;as Appian relates.</p>

<p>"But a prince shall oppose his conquests and cause the reproach
offered by him to cease,"&mdash;Scipio Africanus, who stopped
the progress of Antiochus the Great because he offended the
Romans in the person of their allies.&mdash;"He will return into his
kingdom and perish and be no more."&mdash;He was killed by his
soldiers.</p>

<p>"And he who stands in his place shall be a tyrant, a raiser of
taxes in the glory of the kingdom," that is the people, Seleucus
Philopator or Soter, the son of Antiochus the Great&mdash;"but within
a few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger nor in battle;</p>

<p>"And in his place shall stand up a vile person, unworthy of the
honour of the kingdom, but he shall come in by skilful flatteries.</p>

<p>"All armies shall bend before him, he will conquer them,
and even the prince with whom he has made a league. For
having renewed the league with him, he will deceive him, and
come in with a few tribes into his province, calm and without
fear. He will take the best places, and shall do that which his
fathers have not done, and ravage on all sides. He will forecast
devices, during his time."</p>

<p><em>The reprobation of the Jews and conversion of the Gentiles.</em>&mdash;Isaiah
lxv. "I am sought of them that asked not for me; I am
found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold
me, unto a nation that did not call upon my name.</p>

<p>"I have spread out my hands all the day unto an unbelieving
people, which walketh in a way that was not good, after their
own thoughts; a people that provoketh me to anger continually
to my face; that sacrificeth to idols, etc.</p>

<p>"These shall be scattered like smoke in the day of my
wrath, etc.</p>

<p>"Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers will I
gather, and will requite you according to your works.</p>

<p>"Thus saith the Lord, As the new wine is found in the cluster,
and one saith, Destroy it not; for a blessing is in it.</p>

<p>"So will I take a seed of Jacob and Judah to possess my
mountains, and mine elect and my servants shall inherit it, and
my fertile and abundant plains, but I will destroy all others,
because you have forgotten your God to follow strange gods. I
have called you and you have not answered, I have spoken and
you have not heard, and you have chosen the things which I
forbade.</p>

<p>"Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, my servants shall eat,
but ye shall be hungry; my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall
be ashamed; my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall
cry and howl for vexation of spirit.</p>

<p>"And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen:
for the Lord shall slay thee, and call his servants by another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
name, that he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself
in God, etc.; because the former troubles are forgotten.</p>

<p>"For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the
former things shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.</p>

<p>"But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create: for,
behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.
And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the
voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of
crying....</p>

<p>"Before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking,
I will hear. The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and
the lion shall eat straw like the ox: and dust shall be the serpent's
meat. They shall not hurt nor kill in all my holy mountain."</p>

justice: for my salvation is near to come, and my righteousness
to be revealed.</p>

keepeth my salvation and holdeth his hand from doing any evil.</p>

<p>"Neither let the strangers, that have joined themselves to the
Lord, say, God will separate me from his people. For thus saith
the Lord: Whoso will keep my sabbaths, and choose the things
that please me, and take hold of my covenant; Even unto them
will I give in mine house a place and a name better than of sons
and of daughters: I will give them an everlasting name, that
shall not be cut off....</p>

<p>"Therefore is judgment far from us: we wait for light, but
behold obscurity; for brightness, but we walk in darkness. We
grope for the wall like the blind: we stumble at noon day as in

be your God, and ye shall be my people. For it was only after
they had sacrificed to golden calves that I gave myself sacrifices

my servant, in whom I will be glorified. And I said, Lord, have
I laboured in vain? have I spent my strength for nought? yet
is my judgment with thee, O Lord, and my work before thee.
When the Lord, who has formed me from the womb of my
mother to be wholly for himself, in order to bring Jacob and
Israel again to him, said unto me: Thou shalt be glorious in
my sight, and I will be thy strength. It is a light thing that
thou shouldst convert the tribes of Jacob; I will also give thee
for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation
unto the ends of the earth. These are the things which the
Lord hath said to him that humbleth his soul to him whom the
nation abhorreth, to a servant of rulers. Princes and kings shall
worship thee because the Lord is faithful that hath chosen thee.</p>

<p>"Again the Lord said unto me: I have heard thee in the
days of salvation and of mercy, and I have established thee for
a covenant of the people, and to cause thee to inherit the
desolate nations, that thou mayest say to those who are in
chains: Go forth, and to those that are in darkness: Come
into the light, and possess these abundant and fertile lands.
They shall no more labour, nor hunger, nor thirst, neither shall
the sun smite them; for he that hath mercy on them shall lead
them, even by the springs of waters shall he guide them, and
make the mountains plain before them. Behold, the peoples
shall come from all parts, from the East and from the West,
from the North and from the South. Let the heaven give glory
to God, let the earth rejoice, for it hath pleased the Lord to
comfort his people, and he will have mercy on the poor who
hope in him.</p>

<p>"Yet Sion hath dared to say: The Lord hath forsaken and
hath forgotten me. Can a woman forget her sucking child,
that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb,
but if she forget, yet will I not forget thee, O Sion. I will bear
thee always between my hands, and thy walls shall be ever
before me. Thy builders are come, thy destroyers shall go
forth of thee. Lift up thy eyes round about, and see all these
are gathered together, to come to thee: as I live, saith the
Lord, thou shall be clothed with all these as with an ornament,
thy deserts, and thy desolate places, and the land of thy destruction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
shall now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants,
and the children of thy barrenness shall still say in thy ears:
the place is too strait for me, make me room to dwell in. And
thou shall say in thy heart: Who hath begotten these? I was
barren and brought not forth, led away, and captive: and who
hath brought up these? I was destitute and alone: and these,
where were they? And the Lord shall say: Behold, I will
lift up my hand to the Gentiles, and will set up my standard
to the people. And they shall bring thy children in their arms,
and in their bosoms. And kings shall be thy nursing fathers,
and queens thy nursing mothers: they shall worship thee with
their face toward the earth, and they shall lick up the dust of
thy feet. And thou shall know that I am the Lord, for they shall
not be confounded that wait for him. Shall the prey be taken
from the strong and mighty? But even if the captivity be taken
away from the strong: nothing can hinder me to judge those
that have judged thee, and thy children I will save. And all
flesh shall know, that I am the Lord thy Saviour, and thy
Redeemer the mighty One of Jacob.</p>

<p>"Thus saith the Lord: What is this divorcement, wherewith
I have put away the synagogue, and why have I delivered it
into the hands of your enemies; is it not for your iniquities and
your transgressions that I have put it away?</p>

<p>"For I came, and no man would receive me, I called and
none would hear. Is my arm shortened that I cannot save?</p>

<p>"Therefore will I show the tokens of my anger, I will clothe
the heavens with darkness, and will make sackcloth their
covering.</p>

<p>"The Lord hath given me the tongue of the learned that I
should know how to uphold by word him that is weary. He
hath wakened my ear, and I have heard him as a master.</p>

<p>"The Lord hath revealed his will and I was not rebellious.</p>

<p>"I gave my body to the smiters, and my cheeks to outrage,
I hid not my face from shame and spitting, but the Lord has
helped me, therefore I was not confounded.</p>

<p>"He is near that justifieth me; who will contend with me, and
accuse me of sin, since God himself is my protector?</p>

<p>"All men shall pass and be consumed by time, let those that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
fear the Lord hearken to the words of his servant, let him that
languisheth in darkness put his trust in the Lord. But as for
you, you do but set alight upon you the wrath of God, you walk
upon the coals and among the flames you have kindled. This
ye have of my hand, ye shall perish in sorrow.</p>

<p>"Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that
seek the Lord: look unto the rock whence ye are hewn, and to
the hole of the pit whence ye are digged. Look unto Abraham
your father, and unto Sarah that bare you: for I called him
when he was alone, and childless, and increased him. For the
Lord has comforted Zion: and has heaped on her blessings
and consolations.</p>

<p>"Hearken unto me, my people; and give ear unto me, for a
law shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment to
rest for a light of the Gentiles."</p>

<p>Amos viii. The prophet having enumerated the sins of
Israel, said that God had sworn to take vengeance on them.</p>

<p>He saith also: "And it shall come to pass in that day, saith
the Lord, that the sun shall go down at mid-day, and I will
make the earth dark in the day of light: And I will turn your
feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation.</p>

<p>"You shall have sorrow and suffering, and I will make the
sorrow as the mourning of an only son, and the latter end thereof
as a bitter day. Behold the days come, saith the Lord, and I
will send forth a famine into the land: not a famine of bread,
nor a thirst of water, but of hearing the words of the Lord. And
they shall move from sea to sea, and from the North to the East:
they shall go about seeking the word of the Lord, and shall not
find it.</p>

<p>"In that day their fair virgins, and their young men shall faint
for thirst. They that have followed the idols of Samaria, and
sworn by the god of Dan; who have followed the worship of
Beersheba; they shall fall, and shall rise no more."</p>

<p>Amos iii. 2. "Of all nations of the earth, I have chosen you
only to be my people."</p>

<p>Daniel xii. 7. Daniel having described all the extent of
Messiah's reign, says, "All these things shall be done when the
dispersion of my people shall be accomplished."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>Haggai ii. 3. "You who compare this second house with the glory
of the first and despise it. Yet now take courage, O Zerubbabel,
saith the Lord, and take courage O Jesus the high priest, and
take courage, all ye people of the land, and cease not to work.
The word that I covenanted with you when you came out of
the land of Egypt stands yet: and my spirit shall be in the
midst of you: Lose not hope. For thus saith the Lord of
hosts: Yet one little while, and I will move the heaven and the
earth, and the sea, and the dry land,"&mdash;a mode of speech to
denote a great and extraordinary change. "And I will move
all nations: and the desired of all nations shall come: and I
will fill this house with glory: saith the Lord.</p>

<p>"The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the Lord,"&mdash;that
is to say, it is not by that that I will be honoured, as it is
said in another place. All the beasts of the field are mine,
what good is it to me that they are offered me in sacrifice?&mdash;"Greater
shall be the glory of this latter house than of the
first, saith the Lord of hosts: and in this place I will establish
my house, saith the Lord."</p>

<p>"According to all that you desired of the Lord God in Horeb
in the day of the assembly, saying, Let us not hear again the
voice of the Lord, neither let us see this fire any more, that we
die not. And the Lord said unto me, Their prayer is just. I
will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren, like
unto thee, and I will put my words in his mouth; and he shall
speak unto them all that I shall command him. And it shall
come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto my words
which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him."</p>

<p>Genesis xlix. "Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall
praise, and thou shall vanquish thine enemies; thy father's
children shall bow down before thee. Judah, lion's whelp, thou
art gone up to the prey, O my son, and art couched as a lion,
and as a lioness awakened.</p>

<p>"The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver
from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the
gathering of the people be."</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>OF TYPES IN GENERAL AND OF THEIR
LAWFULNESS.</em></a></h3>
</div>

    <div>

<p class="noindent"><em>Proof of the two Testaments at once.</em>&mdash;To prove both the Testaments
at one stroke we need only see if the prophecies in one
are accomplished in the other.</p>

<p>To examine the prophecies we must understand them.</p>

<p>For if we believe they have only one sense it is certain that
Messiah has not come; but if they have two senses, it is certain
that he has come in Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>The whole question then is to know if they have two senses....</p>

<p>That the Scripture has two senses, which Jesus Christ and his
Apostles have given, the following are the proofs:</p>

<p>1. Proof by Scripture itself.</p>

<p>2. Proofs by the Rabbis. Moses Maimonides says that it has
two faces, and that the prophets have prophesied Jesus Christ
only.</p>

<p>3. Proofs by the Cabala.</p>

<p>4. Proofs by the mystical interpretation which the rabbis themselves
have given to the Scripture.</p>

<p>5. Proofs by the principles laid down by the rabbis that there are
two senses, that there are two advents of the Messiah; one in glory,
and one in humiliation, according to their deserts; that the prophets
have prophesied of Messiah only. The Law is not eternal,
but must change when Messiah comes; that then they shall
no more remember the Red Sea; that the Jews and the Gentiles
shall be mingled.</p>

<br />

<p>It is as those among whom there is a certain secret language.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>Those who do not understand it can see in it only a foolish
sense.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Typical.</em>&mdash;The figures of a sword, a shield.</p>

<p><em>Potentissime.</em></p>

<br />

<p>To change the type, because of our weakness.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Types.</em>&mdash;The prophets prophesied by figures of a girdle, a beard
and burnt hair, etc.</p>

<br />

<p>Two errors: 1, to take all literally; 2, to take all spiritually.</p>

<br />

<p>The veil which is upon these books for the Jews is there also
for bad Christians, and for all who do not hate themselves.</p>

<p>But those who truly hate themselves are in a disposition to
understand the Scriptures and to know Jesus Christ.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Types</em>.&mdash;To show that the Old Testament is only figurative,
and that by temporal possessions the prophets understood
others, this is the proof: 1, that this were unworthy of God;
2, that their discourses express very clearly the promise of
temporal possessions, and that they say nevertheless that their
discourses are obscure, and that their sense will not be understood.
Whence it appears that this secret sense is not that which
they openly expressed, and that consequently they meant to
speak of other sacrifices, of another deliverer, etc. They say that
they will be understood only in the fulness of time. Jer. xxxiii.</p>

<p>The third proof is that their discourses are contradictory and
destroy each other, so that if we think they did not mean by
the words law and sacrifice aught else than those of Moses, there
is a gross and obvious contradiction. Therefore they meant
something else, occasionally contradicting themselves in the
same chapter.</p>

<p>Now to understand the sense of an author....</p>

<br />

<p><em>A type brings with it absence and presence, pleasure and pain.</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>A cipher with a double sense, one clear, and in which it is
said that the sense is hidden....</p>

<br />

<p>A portrait brings with it absence and presence, pleasure and
pain. The reality excludes absence and pain.</p>

<p><em>Types.</em>&mdash;To know if the law and the sacrifices are real or
figurative, we must see if the prophets in speaking of these
things limited their view and their thoughts to them, so that
they saw only the old covenant; or if they saw in them somewhat
else of which they were the semblance, for in a portrait we see the
thing figured. For this we need only examine what they say.</p>

<p>When they speak of it as eternal, do they mean that same
covenant which they elsewhere say will be changed; so of the
sacrifices, etc.?</p>

<p>A cipher has two senses. If we intercept an important letter
in which we see an obvious meaning, wherein it is nevertheless
declared that the sense is veiled and obscure, that it is concealed,
so that the letter might be read without discovering it,
and understood without understanding, we can but think that
here is a cipher with a double sense, and all the more if we find
manifest contradictions in the literal sense. How greatly we
ought to value those who interpret the cipher, and explain to
us the hidden sense, especially if the principles they extract
are wholly natural and clear. This is what Jesus Christ did,
and the Apostles. They broke the seal, he rent the veil, and
revealed the spirit. They have thereby taught us that man's
enemies are his passions; that the Redeemer is to be spiritual
and his reign spiritual; that there are to be two advents, one in
lowliness to abase the proud, the other in glory to exalt the
humble; that Jesus Christ is God and man.</p>

<p>The prophets said clearly that Israel would be always the
beloved of God, that the law would be eternal, they have said
also that their meaning would not be understood, and that it
was veiled.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Types.</em>&mdash;When the word of God, which cannot lie, is false
literally, it is true spiritually. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sede a dextris meis</i>, is false literally,
therefore it is true spiritually.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>In these expressions God is spoken of after the manner of
men, and this means only that the intention which men have
in giving a seat at their right hand, God will also have. It is
then a mark of the intention of God, not of his mode of carrying
it out.</p>

<p>Thus when it is said "God has received the odour of your incense
and will in return give you a fat land," this means that the
same intention which a man will have, who, pleased with your
perfumes, will give you a fat land, God will have towards you,
because you have had towards him the same intention as a man
has for him to whom he offers a sweet savour. So <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">iratus est</i>, a
jealous God, etc., for the things of God being inexpressible, they
cannot be said otherwise. And the Church uses them still: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quia
confortavit seras</i>, etc.</p>

<br />

<p>Difference between dinner and supper.</p>

<p>In God the word differs not from the intention, for he is true,
nor the word from the effect, for he is powerful, nor the means
from the effect, for he is wise. Bern. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ult. sermo in Missam</i>.</p>

<p>Aug., <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">de Civit.</cite> v. 10. This rule is general. God can do all,
except those things which if he could do he would not be
almighty, as dying, being deceived, lying, etc.</p>

<p>Many evangelists for the confirmation of the truth. Their
differences are useful.</p>

<p>The Eucharist after the Lord's Supper. Truth after the
type.</p>

<p>The ruin of Jerusalem, a type of the ruin of the world, forty
years after the death of Jesus.</p>

<p>"I know not" as a man or as an ambassador. Matt. xxiv. 36.</p>

<p>Jesus condemned by the Jews and the Gentiles.</p>

<p>The Jews and the Gentiles figured by the two sons.</p>

<p>Aug. <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">de Civit.</cite> xx. 29.</p>

<br />

<p>The figures of the Gospel for the state of the sick soul are sick
bodies, but because one body cannot be sufficiently sick to
express it well, several are needed. Thus there are the deaf, the
dumb, the blind, the paralytic, the dead Lazarus, the possessed;
all this together is in the sick soul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>Isaiah, li. The Red Sea an image of the Redemption.</p>

<p>"<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ut sciatis quod filius hominis habet potestatem remittendi
peccata, tibi dico: Surge.</i>"</p>

<p>God, willing to show that he was able to form a people holy
with an invisible holiness, and to fill them with an eternal glory,
made visible things. As nature is an image of grace, he
has done in the excellences of nature what he would accomplish
in those of grace, in order that men might judge that he could
make the invisible since he made the visible so well.</p>

<p>Thus he saved this people from the deluge, he has raised them
up from Abraham, redeemed them from their enemies, and
caused them to enter into rest.</p>

<p>The object of God was not to save them from the deluge, and
raise up a whole people to Abraham, only in order to bring them
into a fat land.</p>

<p>And so grace itself is but the figure of glory, for it is not the
ultimate end. It was symbolised by the law, and itself symbolises
grace, but it is the figure of it, and the origin or cause.</p>

<p>The ordinary life of man is like that of the saints. They all
seek their satisfaction, and differ only in the object wherein they
place it; they call those their enemies who hinder them, etc.
God then has shown the power which he has to give invisible
possessions, by the power which he has shown over things visible.</p>

<br />

<p>And yet this covenant, made to blind some and enlighten
others, marked in those very men whom it blinded the truth which
should be recognised by others. For the visible possessions
which they received from God were so great and so divine that
it certainly appeared he was able to give them those which are
invisible, as well as a Messiah.</p>

<p>For nature is an image of grace, and visible miracles are the
image of the invisible. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ut sciatis, tibi dico: Surge.</i></p>

<p>Isaiah, li., says that Redemption will be as the passage of the
Red Sea.</p>

<p>God then has shown by the deliverance from Egypt, and from
the sea, by the defeat of the kings, by the manna, by the whole
genealogy of Abraham, that he was able to save, to send down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
bread from heaven, etc., so that the people at enmity with him is
the type and the representation of the very Messiah whom they
know not, etc.</p>

<p>He has then shown us at last that all these things were only
types, and what is true freedom, a true Israelite, true circumcision,
true bread from heaven, etc.</p>

<p>In these promises each man finds what he chiefly desires,
temporal possessions or spiritual, God or the creatures; but with
this difference, that those who therein seek the creatures find them,
but attended by many contradictions, with a prohibition against
loving them, with the injunction to worship God only, and to
love him only, which is the same thing, and finally that the
Messiah came not for them; whilst on the contrary those who
therein seek God find him, without any contradiction, with the
injunction to love him only, and that the Messiah came in the
time foretold, to give them the possessions which they ask.</p>

<p>Thus the Jews had miracles and prophecies, of which they saw
the accomplishment, and the teaching of their law was that they
should love and worship God alone; it was also perpetual. Thus
it had all the marks of the true religion, as indeed it was, but we
must distinguish between the teaching of the Jews, and the
teaching of the Jewish law. Now the teaching of the Jews was
not true, although it had miracles and prophecy and perpetuity,
because it had not this further point, the worship and love of
God only.</p>

<br />

<p><em>The reason of types.</em></p>

<p>They had to deal with a carnal people, and to render them
the depositary of a spiritual covenant.</p>

<p>To give faith in the Messiah it was necessary there should
have been antecedent prophecies, in the charge of persons above
suspicion, diligent, faithful, singularly zealous, and known to all
the world.</p>

<p>That all this might be accomplished, God chose this carnal
people, to whom he entrusted the prophecies which foretell the
Messiah as a deliverer, and as a dispenser of those carnal possessions
which the people loved. And thus they have had an
extraordinary zeal for their prophets, and, in sight of the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
world, have had charge of these books which foretell their
Messiah, assuring all the nations that he should come, and in the
manner foretold in their books, which they held open to all the
world. But this people deceived by the poor and ignominious
advent of the Messiah have been his most cruel enemies. So that
they, who were of all nations in the world the least open to the
suspicion of favouring us, the most scrupulous and most zealous
that can be named for their law and their prophets, have kept the
records incorrupt.</p>

<br />

<p>Therefore the prophecies have a hidden and spiritual sense,
which this people hated, under the carnal sense which they loved.
Had the spiritual sense been disclosed, it being such as they
were unable to love, or even to bear, they would not have
been zealous to preserve their books and their ceremonies; and
if they had loved these spiritual promises, and had preserved
them incorrupt till Messiah came, their witness would have had
no force, because they had been his friends. Therefore it was well
that the spiritual sense should be concealed; but on the other
hand, had the sense been so hidden as not to be at all apparent,
it could not have served as a proof of the Messiah. What then
was done? In a crowd of passages the spiritual was concealed
under the temporal sense, and has been clearly revealed in a few;
again, the time and the state of the world were so clearly foretold
that the sun is not so evident. And in some passages this
spiritual sense is so dearly expressed that no less a blindness
than that which the flesh imposes on the spirit when enslaved,
can keep us from discerning it.</p>

<p>See then what God has done. This sense is concealed under
another in an infinite number of passages, in some, though rarely,
it is revealed, yet so that the passages in which it is concealed are
equivocal, and can suit both senses, while those in which it is
disclosed are unequivocal, and can agree with the spiritual sense
alone.</p>

<p>So that this cannot lead us into error, and could only be
misunderstood by so carnal a people.</p>

<p>For when possessions are promised in abundance, what could
hinder them from understanding the true possessions, save their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
covetousness, which limited the sense to the good things of this
world? But those whose only good was in God referred the sense
to him alone. For there are two qualities which divide the will
of man, covetousness and charity. Not that covetousness cannot
coexist with faith in God, nor charity with worldly possessions,
but covetousness uses God, and enjoys the world, while the
opposite is the case with charity.</p>

<p>Now the end we pursue gives names to things. All which
hinders the attainment of this end, is said to be at enmity with
us. Thus the creatures, however good, are the enemies of the
just, when they turn them aside from God, and God himself is
the enemy of those whose greed he opposes.</p>

<p>Hence the word enemy being interpreted according to the end
proposed, the just understood by it their passions, and the carnal
understood the Babylonians, so that the term is obscure only for
the unrighteous. And this is what Isaiah says: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Signa legem in
electis meis</i>, and that Jesus Christ shall be a stone of stumbling.
But, "Blessed are they who shall not be offended in him!" Hosea,
xiv. 9, says excellently: "Where is the wise, and he shall
understand these things. The just shall know them, for the
ways of God are right, but the transgressors shall fall therein."</p>

<p>So that those who rejected and crucified Jesus Christ, being
offended at him, are the same people who bear the books which
witness of him, and which say that he will be rejected and a
stumbling stone, so that their refusal has given an additional
mark that it is he, and he has been proved both by the just Jews
who received him, and the unjust Jews who rejected him, both of
whom were foretold.</p>

<br />

<p>One of the main reasons why the prophets put a veil on the
spiritual possessions which they promised under the figure of
temporal possessions is, that they had to do with a carnal people
whom they must make the keepers of the spiritual covenant.</p>

<br />

<p>Jesus Christ, prefigured by Joseph, the beloved of his father,
sent by his father to visit his brethren, etc., innocent, sold by his
brethren for twenty pieces of silver, and thereby becoming their
lord, their saviour, the saviour of strangers, and the saviour of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
world; all which had not been brought about but for the plot for
his destruction, their sale and rejection of him.</p>

<p>In prison Joseph innocent between two criminals; Jesus
Christ on the cross between two thieves. Joseph foretold deliverance
to the one, and death to the other, from the same omens.
Jesus Christ saves the elect, and condemns the reprobate after
the same crimes. Joseph foretold only, Jesus Christ acts.
Joseph asked of him who is saved to be mindful of him when
he has come into his glory, and he whom Jesus Christ saved
asked that he would remember him when he came into his
Kingdom.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Types.</em>&mdash;Saviour, father, sacrificer, sacrifice, food, king, wise,
lawgiver, afflicted, poor, having to create a people, which he
must lead and nourish, and bring into the land.</p>

<br />

<p>Fascination.&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Somnum suum. Figura hujus mundi.</i></p>

<p>The Eucharist.&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Comedes panem tuum. Panem nostrum.</i></p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Inimici Dei terram lingent.</i> The sinners lick the dust, that is
to say, love earthly pleasures.</p>

<p>The Old Testament contained the types of future joy, and
the New contains the means of attaining it.</p>

<p>The types were of joy, the means of penitence, and nevertheless
the Paschal Lamb was eaten with bitter herbs, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cum
amaritudinibus</i>.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Singularis sum ego donec transeam.</i> Jesus Christ before his
death was almost the only martyr.</p>

<br />

<p>To speak against too greatly figurative expressions.</p>

<br />

<p>There are some types clear and demonstrative, but others
which seem far-fetched, and which bring proof only to those
already persuaded. These may seem like the sayings of the
Apocalyptics. But the difference is that these have none which
are not doubtful, so that nothing is so unjust as to pretend that
theirs are as well founded as some of ours, for they have none so
demonstrative as some of ours. There is no comparison possible.
We have no right to compare and confound things because they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
agree in one point, while they are so different in another. What
is clear in things divine forces us to revere what is obscure.</p>

<br />

<p>I do not say that the <em>mem</em> is a mystery.</p>

<br />

<p>We may not attribute to the Scripture the sense which it has
not revealed to us that it contains. Thus, to say that the closed
<em>mem</em> of Isaiah means six hundred, has not been revealed. It might
be said that the final <em>tsadé</em> and the <em>he deficientes</em> signify mysteries.
But we are not allowed to say so, and still less to say this is the
way of the philosopher's stone. But we say that the literal
sense is not the true sense, because the prophets said so
themselves.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Extravagances of the Apocalyptics, Preadamites, Millenarians,
etc.</em>&mdash;Whoever would found extravagant opinions on the
Scripture will for instance found them on the fact that:</p>

<p>It is said that "This generation shall not pass away till all
these things be fulfilled." On that I will say that after that
generation will come another generation, and so in constant
succession.</p>

<p>The Second Book of Chronicles speaks of Solomon and the
King as if they were two different persons. I say that they
were two.</p>

are puffed up when they find one which seems to favour their
error.</em></p>

the King.</p>

<p>Explanation of these words: "He that is not with me is
against me." And these others: "He that is not against you is

ought to answer him.... One of the Antiphons for Vespers at

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>THAT THE JEWISH LAW WAS
FIGURATIVE.</em></a></h3>
</div>

    <div>

<p class="noindent"><em>Contradiction.</em>&mdash;It is not possible to give a good expression to
a portrait save by bringing all contraries into harmony, and it is
not enough to dwell upon a series of accordant qualities, without
reconciling the contraries. To understand the meaning of an
author we must harmonise all the contrary passages.</p>

<p>Thus, to understand Scripture, we must find a sense in
which all the contrary passages are reconciled; it is not enough
to have one which agrees with many consonant passages, but
we must find one which reconciles even dissonant passages.</p>

<p>Every author has a sense in which all the contradictory
passages agree, or he has no meaning at all. The latter cannot
be said of Scripture and the prophets, which assuredly abound
in good sense. We must then seek for a meaning which
harmonises all contraries.</p>

<p>The true sense then is not that of the Jews, but in Jesus
Christ all dissonances are brought into harmony.</p>

<p>The Jews could not make the cessation of the royalty and
principality foretold by Hosea accord with the prophecy of
Jacob.</p>

<p>If we take the law, the sacrifices, the kingdom as realities, we
cannot reconcile all the passages. Of necessity then they are but
figures. We cannot even reconcile the passages of the same
author, nor of the same book, nor sometimes of the same
chapter, which abundantly denotes what was the meaning
of the author. As when Ezekiel, chap. xx., says that man will
live by the commandments of God and will not live by them.</p>

<br />

<p>It was not lawful to sacrifice elsewhere than at Jerusalem, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
place which the Lord had chosen, nor even to eat the tithes in
any other place. Deut. xii. 5, etc.; Deut. xiv. 23, etc.; xv. 20;
xvi. 2-15.</p>

<p>Hosea foretold that the Jews should be without king, without
prince, without sacrifice and without idols, which is accomplished
at this day, since they are not able to make a lawful
sacrifice out of Jerusalem.</p>

<p><em>Types.</em>&mdash;If the law and the sacrifices are the truth it must
be pleasing to God, and not displeasing to him. If they are
figures they must be both pleasing and displeasing.</p>

<p>Now through the whole of Scripture they are both pleasing
and displeasing. It is said that the law shall be changed, that
the sacrifice shall be changed, that they shall be without law,
without a prince and without sacrifices, that a new covenant shall
be made, that the law shall be renewed, that the precepts which
they have received are not good, that their sacrifices are
abominations, that God has required none of them.</p>

<p>It is said, on the contrary, that the law shall abide for ever,
that the covenant shall be eternal, that sacrifice shall be eternal,
that the sceptre shall never depart from among them, because
it shall not depart from them till the coming of the eternal
King.</p>

<p>Now are all these passages obviously literal? No. Are
they obviously typical? No, they are obviously either real or
typical. But the first set, which bar a literal interpretation,
prove that the whole are typical.</p>

<p>All these passages together cannot apply to the thing signified,
all can apply to the type, therefore they are not spoken of the
thing signified, but of the type.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Agnus occisus est ab origine mundi.</i> A sacrificing judge.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Types.</em>&mdash;God willing to form to himself an holy people,
whom he should separate from all other nations, whom he
should deliver from their enemies, and should establish in a place
of rest, has not only promised this, but has foretold by his
prophets the time and the manner of his coming. And yet, to
confirm the hope of his elect through all ages, he made them
to see it in a figure, but never left them without assurances of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
his power and of his will to save them. For at the creation of
man, Adam was the witness, and the guardian of the promise made
concerning the Saviour who should be born of the woman, when
men were still so near the creation that they could not have forgotten
their creation and their fall. When those who had seen
Adam were no longer in the world, God sent Noah, whom he
saved, and drowned the whole earth by a miracle which marked
sufficiently both the power which he had to save the world,
and the will which he had to do so; and to raise up of the seed
of the woman him whom he had promised.</p>

<p>This miracle was enough to confirm the hope of men. The
memory of the deluge being fresh among men while Noah was
still living, God made promises to Abraham, and while Shem
was still living God sent Moses, etc....</p>

<br />

<p><em>Types.</em>&mdash;God, willing to deprive his own of perishable possessions,
made the Jewish people in order to show that this arose
from no lack of power.</p>

<br />

<p>The Jews had grown old in these earthly thoughts, that God
loved their father Abraham, his flesh, and all that would spring
from it; that for this reason he had multiplied them, and set
them apart from all other peoples, without allowing them to
intermingle; that when they were languishing in Egypt he
brought them out with many wonderful signs in their favour;
that he fed them with manna in the wilderness, and brought
them out into a very fat land; that he gave them kings and a
well-built temple, there to offer beasts before him, by the shedding
of whose blood they were purified; that at last he would send
Messiah to make them masters of the whole world, and foretold
the time of his coming.</p>

<p>The world having grown old in these carnal errors, Jesus
Christ came at the time foretold, but not with the expected glory,
and therefore men did not think it was he. After his death Saint
Paul came to teach that all these things had happened in figures,
that the Kingdom of God was not in the flesh, but in the spirit;
that the enemies of men were not the Babylonians, but the
passions; that God delighted not in temples made with hands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
but in a pure and contrite heart; that bodily circumcision was
unprofitable, but that of the heart was needed; that Moses gave
them not that bread from heaven, etc.</p>

<p>But God, not willing to disclose these things to a people unworthy
of them, yet nevertheless willing to foretell them, in order
that they might be believed, foretold the time dearly, and
expressed the things sometimes clearly, but generally in figures,
so that those who loved the emblems might rest in them, and
those who loved the things figured might see them therein.</p>

<p>All that tends not to charity is figurative.</p>

<p>The sole aim of the Scripture is charity.</p>

<p>All which tends not to that only end is figurative, for since
there is but one end, all which does not refer to it in express
terms is figurative.</p>

<p>God has so varied that sole precept of charity to satisfy our
curiosity, which seeks for diversity, by that diversity which still
leads us to the one thing needful. For one only thing is needful,
yet we love diversity, and God satisfies both by these diversities,
which lead to the one thing needful.</p>

<p>The Jews so loved the mere shadows, and waited for them
so entirely, that they misunderstood the substance, when it came
in the time and manner foretold.</p>

<p>The rabbis take the breasts of the Spouse for figures, as they
do every thing which does not express the only aim they had,
that of temporal good.</p>

<p>And Christians take even the Eucharist as a type of the glory
for which they strive.</p>

<br />

<p>Charity is no figurative precept. It is horrible to say that
Jesus Christ, who came to take away the figure and establish the
truth, came only to establish the type of charity and take away
the existing reality.</p>

<p>If the light be darkness, what must the darkness be?</p>

<br />

<p>When David foretold that Messiah would deliver his people
from their enemies, we may believe that these according to the
flesh were the Egyptians, and then I know not how to show that
the prophecy was fulfilled. But we may well believe also that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
enemies were their sins, for in truth the Egyptians were not
their enemies, and their sins were. This word enemies is therefore
equivocal.</p>

<p>But if he say, as in fact he does elsewhere, that he will save
his people from their sins, as do also Isaiah and others, the
ambiguity is removed, and the double sense of enemies is reduced
to the single sense of iniquities. For if he had sins in his mind
he might well denote them by the word enemies, but if he
thought of enemies, he could not designate them by the word
iniquities.</p>

<p>Now Moses, David, and Isaiah employ the same terms. Who
will say then that they have not all the same meaning, and that
the sense of David which is plainly that of iniquities when he
spoke of enemies, is not the same as that of Moses when
speaking of enemies.</p>

<p>Daniel prays that the people may be delivered from the captivity
of their enemies, but he was thinking of sins, and to show
this, he says that Gabriel came to tell him that his prayer was
heard, and that there were only seventy weeks to wait, after
which the nation would be delivered from iniquity, that sin
would have an end, and the Redeemer, the Most Holy, should
bring in eternal righteousness, not legal, but eternal.</p>

<br />

<p>The Jews had a doctrine of God as we have one of Jesus
Christ, and confirmed by miracles; they were forbidden to
believe every worker of miracles, and more, they were ordered
to have recourse to the chief priests, on whom only they should
rely.</p>

<p>Thus, in regard to their prophets, they had all those reasons
which we have for refusing to believe the workers of miracles.</p>

<p>And yet they were very blameworthy in refusing the prophets
because of their miracles, and had not been blameworthy had
they not seen the miracles. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nisi fecissem, peccatum non haberent.</i></p>

<p>Therefore all belief rests on miracles.</p>

<br />

<p>Whoever estimates the Jewish religion by its coarser minds
will know it but ill. It is to be seen in the sacred books, and
in the tradition of the prophets, who have made it plain enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
that they did not understand the law according to the letter. So
our Religion is divine in the Gospel, in the Apostles, and in
tradition, but ridiculous in those who corrupt it.</p>

<p>The Messiah, according to the carnal Jews, was to be a
mighty temporal prince. Jesus Christ, according to carnal
Christians, has come to dispense us from the love of God, and
to give us sacraments which shall operate without our concurrence.
This is no more the Christian religion than was the
other the Jewish.</p>

<p>True Jews and true Christians have always expected a
Messiah who should inspire them with the love of God, and
by that love should make them triumph over all their enemies.</p>

<br />

<p>The carnal Jews hold a midway place between Christians and
Pagans. The Pagans know not God, and love this world
only. The Jews know the true God, and love this world only.
Christians know the true God, and love not the world. Jews
and Pagans love the same good. Jews and Christians know
the same God.</p>

<p>The Jews were of two kinds, one having merely Pagan, the
other having Christian affections.</p>

<br />

<p>The carnal Jews understood neither the greatness nor the
humiliation of Messiah as foretold by their prophecies. They
misunderstood him in his foretold greatness, as when he said that
Messiah should be lord of David, through his son, and that he was
before Abraham who yet had seen him. They did not believe
him so great as to be eternal, and so too they misunderstood him
in his humiliation and in his death. Messiah, said they, abideth
for ever, and this man has said that he shall die. They believed
him then neither mortal nor eternal, and they only looked in
him for a carnal greatness.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Typical.</em>&mdash;God availed himself of the lust of the Jews to make
them avail for Jesus Christ.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Typical.</em>&mdash;Nothing is so like charity as covetousness, and
nothing is so contrary to it. Thus the Jews, full of possessions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
which flattered their covetousness, were very like Christians and
very contrary. And by this means they had the two qualities
which were necessary to them, to be very like the Messiah in
order to be figures of him, and very contrary that they might
not be suspected witnesses.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Antiquity of the Jews.</em>&mdash;What difference there is between
book and book. I am not surprised that the Greeks made the
Iliad, nor the Egyptians and the Chinese their histories.</p>

<p>We have only to see how this comes about. These fabulous
historians are not contemporaneous with the facts they narrate.
Homer writes a romance, which he puts forth as such, and which
is received as such, for no one supposed that Troy or Agamemnon
existed more than did the golden apple. So he thought not of
making a history, but solely a book to amuse; he is the only man
who wrote in his time, the beauty of his work has made it last,
every one learns it and talks of it, we are bound to know it, and
we each get it by heart. Four hundred years afterwards the
witnesses of these things are no more, no one knows of his own
knowledge if it be fable or history; he has only learnt it from
his ancestors, and this may pass for true.</p>

<br />

<p><em>The sincerity of the Jews.</em>&mdash;They preserve with faithfulness and
zeal the book in which Moses declares that they have been all
their life ungrateful to God, and that he knows they will be still
more so after his death; that he therefore calls heaven and earth
to witness against them, and that he has taught them enough.</p>

<p>He declares that finally God, being angry with them, would
scatter them among all the nations of the earth, that as they
have angered him, in worshipping gods who were not their
God, so he will provoke them by calling a people which is
not his people, and wills that all his words shall be eternally
preserved, and that his book shall be placed in the Ark of the
Covenant to serve for ever as a witness against them.</p>

<p>Isaiah says the same thing, xxx. 8.</p>

<br />

<p>However, they have kept at the cost of their life this very
book which dishonours them in so many ways. This is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
sincerity which has no example in the world, and no root in
nature.</p>

<br />

<p>Every history which is not contemporaneous is open to suspicion,
thus the books of the Sibyls and Trismegistus and so
many others which have been credited by the world are false,
and found to be false in course of time. It is not so with contemporaneous
authors.</p>

<p>There is a great difference between a book written by a private
man, and dispersed among a whole people, and a book which
itself creates a people. We cannot doubt that the book is as old
as the people.</p>

<br />

<p>The sincerity of the Jews.</p>

<p>Defective and final letters.</p>

<p>Sincere against their honour, and dying in its defence; this
has no example in the world's history, and no root in nature.</p>

<br />

<p>They are visibly a people expressly formed to serve as
witnesses to the Messiah, Isaiah xliii. 9; xliv. 8, they bear the
books, and love them while they understand them not. And all
this was foretold, that God's judgments might be entrusted to
them, but as a sealed book.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Types.</em>&mdash;When once the secret is disclosed it is impossible
not to see it If the Old Testament be read in this light, we
shall see if the sacrifices were real; if the fatherhood of
Abraham was the true cause of the friendship of God; that the
promised land was not the true place of rest. These were then
but types. If in the same way we examine all those ordained
ceremonies, and all those commandments which are not of
charity, we shall see that they are types.</p>

<p>All these sacrifices and ceremonies were then either figures or
absurdities. But there are things which are clear, and yet too
lofty for us to think them absurdities.</p>

<br />

<p>Adam <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">forma futuri</i>. Six days to form the one, six ages
to form the other. The six days which Moses represents for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
formation of Adam, are but the representation of the six ages to
form Jesus Christ and the Church. If Adam had not sinned,
and Jesus Christ had not come, there had been only one covenant,
only one age of men, and the creation would have been represented
as done at one single time.</p>

<br />

<p>The six ages, the six Fathers of the six ages, the six miracles
at the opening of the six ages, the six mornings at the opening
of the six ages.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Types.</em>&mdash;The Jewish and Egyptian peoples were visibly foretold
by the two men whom Moses met, the Egyptian beating
the Jew, Moses avenging him and slaying the Egyptian while
the Jew was ungrateful.</p>

<br />

<p>The conversion of the Egyptians, Isaiah xix. 19. An altar in
Egypt to the true God.</p>

<br />

<p>The sabbath was only a sign, Exodus xxxi. 13, and in memory
of the deliverance from Egypt. Deut. v. 19. Therefore it is no
more necessary, for we ought to forget Egypt.</p>

<p>Circumcision was only a sign, Gen. xvii. 13, therefore it came
to pass that in the desert they were not circumcised, because they
could not be confounded with other peoples, and after Jesus
Christ came it was no longer needful.</p>

<br />

<p>Those who ordained these sacrifices knew their uselessness,
and those who have declared their uselessness, ceased not to
practise them.</p>

<br />

<p>Your name shall be accursed to my elect, and I will give
them another name.</p>

<p>Harden their heart. How? By flattering their lust, and
making them hope to accomplish it.</p>

<br />

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fac secundum exemplar quod tibi ostensum est in monte.</i></p>

<p>The Jewish religion then was formed on its likeness to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
truth of the Messiah, and the truth of the Messiah was recognised
by the religion of the Jews which was the figure of it.</p>

<p>Among the Jews the truth was only prefigured. In heaven it
is revealed.</p>

<p>In the Church it is hidden, yet recognised by its correspondence
with the type.</p>

<p>The type was made according to the truth, and the truth is
recognised according to the type.</p>

<p>Saint Paul says himself that people would forbid to marry,
and he himself speaks to the Corinthians, in a way which is a
trap. For if a prophet had said the one, and Saint Paul had
afterwards said the other, he would have been accused.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Typical.</em>&mdash;Make all things like unto the pattern which was
showed thee in the mount. On which Saint Paul says that the
Jews shadowed forth heavenly things.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Typical.</em> The key of the cipher. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Veri adoratores. Ecce
agnus Dei qui tollit peccata mundi.</i></p>

<br />

<p><em>That the law was typical. Types.</em>&mdash;The letter kills. All
happened in a figure. This is the cipher which Saint Paul gives
us. Christ must suffer. An humiliated God. Circumcision of
the heart, a true fast, a true sacrifice, a true temple. The
prophets indicated that all these must be spiritual.</p>

<p>Not the meat which perishes, but that which perishes not.</p>

<p>You shall be free indeed. Then the former liberty was only a
type of liberty.</p>

<p>I am the true bread from heaven.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Particular types.</em>&mdash; A double law, double tables of the law, a
double temple, a double captivity.</p>

<br />

<p>The Synagogue did not perish because it was a type, but
because it was no more than a type it fell into servitude. The
type subsisted till the reality came, in order that the Church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
should be always visible, either in the representation which
promised it, or in the substance.</p>

<br />

<p>In the time of the Messiah the people were divided. Those
that were spiritual embraced the Messiah, the carnal remained
to serve as witnesses of him.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>OF THE TRUE RELIGION AND ITS
CHARACTERISTICS.</em></a></h3>
</div>

    <div>

<p class="noindent"><em>For Port Royal. The Beginning, after having explained the
incomprehensibility.</em>&mdash;Since the greatness and the vileness of
man are so evident, it is necessary that the true religion should
declare both that there is in man some great principle of greatness,
and a great principle of vileness.</p>

<p>It must therefore explain these astonishing contradictions.</p>

<p>In order to make man happy, it must show him that there is
a God; that we ought to love him; that our true happiness is
to be in him, our sole evil to be separated from him; it must
recognise that we are full of darkness which hinders us from
knowing and loving him; and that thus, as our duties oblige
us to love God, and our lusts turn us from him, we are full of
injustice. It must explain to us our opposition to God and to
our own good; it must teach us the remedies for these infirmities,
and the means of obtaining them. We must therefore examine all
the religions of the world from this point of view, and see if there
be any other than the Christian which is sufficient for this end.</p>

<p>Shall it be that of the philosophers, who proposed as the only
good the good which is in ourselves? Is this the true good?
Have they found a remedy for our evils? Is the pride of man
cured by equalling him with God? Have those who would level
us to the brutes, or the Mahomedans who present us with
pleasures of the world as the sole good, even in eternity, found
any remedy for our lusts? What religion then will teach us to
cure our pride and our lust? What religion will teach us our
good, our duty, the infirmity which turns us from it, the cause of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
this infirmity, the remedies which can cure it, and the means of
obtaining those remedies? All other religions have failed, let us
see what the wisdom of God can do.</p>

<p>"Look neither for truth," she says, "nor consolation from men.
I am she who framed you, and who alone can teach you what
you are. But you are not now in the state in which I framed
you. I created man holy, innocent, perfect; I filled him with
light and intelligence; I communicated to him my glory and my
wondrous acts. The eye of man beheld then the majesty of
God; he was not then in the darkness which blinds him, nor
subject to death and the miseries which afflict him. But he
could not bear so great a glory without falling into pride. He
would make himself his own centre, and independent of my aid.
He withdrew himself from my rule; and when he made himself
equal to me by the desire of finding his happiness in himself, I
gave him over to self. Then setting in revolt the creatures that
were subject to him, I made them his enemies; so that man is
now become like the beasts, and removed from me until
there scarce remains to him a confused ray of his Creator, so
far has all his knowledge become extinguished or disturbed.
His senses, never the servants, and often the masters of reason,
have carried him astray in pursuit of pleasure. All creatures
either torment or tempt him; and have dominion over him,
either as they subdue him by their strength, or as they melt him
by their charms, a tyranny more terrible and more imperious.</p>

<p>"Such is the present state of man. There remains to him some
feeble instinct of the happiness of his primitive nature, and he is
plunged in the misery of his blindness and his lusts, which
have become his second nature.</p>

<p>"From this principle which I have here laid open to you,
you may discern the cause of those contradictions which, while
they astonish all men, have divided them among such various
opinions. Now mark all the movements of greatness and
glory which the trials of so many miseries are unable to
stifle, and see if the cause of them must not be in another
nature...."</p>

<p><em>For Port Royal to-morrow. Prosopopæa.</em>&mdash;"It is in vain, O
men, that you seek from yourselves the remedy for your miseries.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
All your light can only enable you to know that not in yourselves
will you find truth or good. The Philosophers promised
you these, but gave them not. They neither apprehend what is
your true good nor what is....</p>

<p>"How could they then apply remedies to your diseases, since
they did not even know them? Your chief maladies are pride,
which alienates you from God, and lust, which binds you down
to earth; and they do nought else but nourish one or the other
of these disorders. If they presented God as your end it was
only done to gratify your pride; by making you think that you
are by nature like him and conformed to him. Those who saw the
extravagance of such an assertion did but set you on an opposite
precipice, by tempting you to believe that your nature was of a
piece with that of the beasts, and by inclining you to seek your
good in the lusts which are shared by brutes. This is not the
way to cure you of your unrighteousness, which these sages never
knew. I alone can teach you who you are....</p>

<p>"If you are united to God it is by grace, not by nature.</p>

<p>"If you are abased it is by penitence, not by nature. So this
twofold capacity....</p>

<p>"You are not in the state wherein you were created.</p>

<p>"These two states being presented to you, you cannot but
recognise them.</p>

<p>"Follow your own movements, observe yourselves, and see if
you do not trace the lively characters of these two natures.</p>

<p>"Could so many contradictions be found in a subject that was
simple?"</p>

<br />

<p>I do not mean that you should submit your belief to me without
reason, neither do I aim at your subjection by tyranny. I do
not aim at giving you a reason for everything. And to reconcile
these contradictions, I wish to make you see by convincing proofs,
those divine tokens in me, which will assure you who I am and
will verify my authority by wonders and proofs which you cannot
reject; so that you may then have a reasonable belief in
what I teach you, when you find no other ground for refusing it,
but that you cannot know of yourselves whether it is true or not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<br />

<p>The true nature of man, his true good, true virtue and true
religion are things of which the knowledge is inseparable.</p>

<br />

<p><em>After having understood the whole nature of man.</em>&mdash;That a
religion may be true, it must show knowledge of our nature. It
must know its greatness and meanness, and the cause of both.
What religion but the Christian has shown this knowledge?</p>

<br />

<p>The true religion teaches our duties; our weaknesses, pride
and lust; and the remedies, humility and mortification.</p>

<p>The true religion must teach greatness and misery; must lead
to the esteem and despising of self; to love and to hate.</p>

<br />

<p>The note of true religion must be that it obliges man to love
his God. This is very right, and yet no other religion than ours
has thus commanded; ours has done so. It must also be cognizant
of man's lust and weakness, ours is so. It must have applied
remedies for these defects; one is prayer. No other religion
has asked of God the power to love and obey him.</p>

<br />

<p>If there be one only origin of all things, there must be one
only end of all things; all by him, all for him. The true religion
then must teach us to adore him only, and to love him only.
But since we find ourselves unable to adore what we know not,
or to love aught but ourselves, the same religion which instructs
us in these duties must instruct us also of this inability, and
teach us also the remedies for it. It teaches us that by one man
all was lost, and the bond broken between God and us, and that
by one man the bond has been repaired.</p>

<p>We are born so contrary to this love of God, and it is so
necessary that we must be born sinful, or God would be unjust.</p>

<br />

<p>Every religion is false which as to its faith does not adore one
God as origin of all things, and as to its morals does not
love one sole God as the object of all things.</p>

<br />

<p>In every religion we must be sincere, true heathens, true Jews,
true Christians.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>THE EXCELLENCE OF THE CHRISTIAN
RELIGION.</em></a></h3>
</div>

     <div>

<p class="noindent">When I see the blindness and the misery of man, when I
survey the whole dumb Universe, and man without light, left
to himself, and lost, as it were, in this corner of the Universe,
not knowing who has placed him here, what he has come to do,
what will become of him when he dies, and incapable of any
knowledge whatever, I fall into terror like that of a man who,
having been carried in his sleep to an island desert and terrible,
should awake ignorant of his whereabouts and with no means of
escape; and thereupon I wonder how those in so miserable a
state do not fall into despair. I see other persons around me,
of like nature, I ask them if they are better informed than
I am, and they say they are not; and thereupon these miserable
wanderers, having looked around them, and seen some
objects pleasing to them, have given and attached themselves
to these. As for me, I cannot attach myself to them, and considering
how strongly appearances show that there is something
else than what is visible to me, I have sought to discover whether
this God have not left some impress of himself.</p>

<p>I see many contrary religions, and consequently all false
but one. Each wishes to be believed on its own authority,
and menaces the unbeliever, but I do not therefore believe them.
Every one can say the same, and every one can call himself a
prophet. But I see the Christian religion fulfilling prophecy,
and that is what every one can not do.</p>

<br />

<p>Without this divine knowledge what could men do but either
uplift themselves by that inward conviction of their past greatness
still remaining to them, or be cast down in view of their present
infirmity? For, not seeing the whole truth, they could not attain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
to perfect virtue. Some considering nature as incorrupt, others
as incurable, they could not escape either pride or idleness, the
two sources of all vice; since they cannot but either abandon
themselves to it by cowardice, or escape it by pride. For if
they were aware of the excellency of man, they were ignorant of
his corruption, so that they very easily avoided idleness, but
only to fall into pride. And if they recognized the infirmity of
nature, they knew not its dignity, so that though they might
easily avoid presumption, it was only to plunge into despair.</p>

<p>Thence come the various sects of the Stoics and Epicureans,
the Dogmatists, Academicians, etc. The Christian religion
alone has been able to cure these two distempers, not so as to
drive out the one by the other according to the wisdom of the
world, but so as to expel them both by the simplicity of the
Gospel. For it teaches the righteous that it lifts them even to a
participation of the divine nature; that in this exalted state they
still bear within them the fountain of all corruption, which
renders them during their whole life subject to error and misery,
to death and sin; and at the same time it proclaims to the most
wicked that they can receive the grace of their Redeemer. Thus
making those tremble whom it justifies, and consoling those
whom it condemns, religion so justly tempers fear with hope by
means of that double capacity of grace and of sin which is
common to all, that it abases infinitely more than reason alone,
yet without despair; and exalts infinitely higher than natural
pride, yet without puffing up: hereby proving that alone being
exempt from error and vice, it alone has the office of instructing
and of reforming men.</p>

<p>Who then can withhold credence and adoration to so divine
a light? For it is clearer than day that we feel within ourselves
indelible characters of goodness; and it is equally true that we
experience every hour the effects of our deplorable condition.
This chaos then, this monstrous confusion, does but proclaim the
truth of these two states, with a voice so powerful that it cannot
be resisted.</p>

<br />

<p>The Philosophers never prescribed feelings proper to these two
states.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>They inspired motions of simple greatness, and that is not the
state of man.</p>

<p>They inspired motions of simple vileness, and that is not the
state of man.</p>

<p>There must be motions of abasement, yet not from nature, but
from penitence, not to rest in them, but to go onward to greatness.
There must be motions of greatness, not from merit, but
from grace, and after having passed through abasement.</p>

<br />

<p>This double nature of man is so evident, that there are those
who have imagined us to have two souls.</p>

<p>One single subject seemed to them incapable of so great and
sudden variations from unmeasured pride to an horrible dejection
of spirit.</p>

<br />

<p>All these contradictions which seemed to have taken me
further from the knowledge of religion, are what most rapidly
led me into truth.</p>

<br />

<p>Did we not know ourselves full of pride, ambition, lust, weakness,
misery and injustice, we were indeed blind. And if
knowing this we did not desire deliverance, what could be said of
a man.... What then can we feel but esteem for that Religion
which is so well acquainted with the defects of man, and desire
for the truth of a religion which promises remedies so precious.</p>

<br />

<p>The corruption of reason is shown by the number of differing
and extravagant customs; it was necessary that truth should
come in order that man should no longer live in himself.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Incomprehensible.</em>&mdash;Not all that is incomprehensible is therefore
non existent. Infinite number. An infinite space equal to
a finite.</p>

<p><em>It is incredible that God should unite himself to us.</em>&mdash;This
consideration is drawn only from the view of our vileness. But
if it be sincere, follow it as far as I have done, and recognise that
we are in fact so vile as to make us by ourselves incapable of
knowing whether his mercy may not render us capable of him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
For I would know how this animal, who is aware of his weakness,
has the right to measure the mercy of God and set to it bounds
suggested by his fancy. He knows so little what God is that he
does not even know what himself is, and troubled with the
view of his own state, boldly declares that God cannot render
man capable of communion with him.</p>

<p>But I would ask if God demands aught else from him than
to know him and to love him, and why, since man is by nature
capable of love and knowledge, he believes that God cannot make
himself known and loved by him. He certainly knows at least
that he is, and that he loves something. Therefore if he see
anything in his darkness, and if among the things of earth he
find any subject of his love, why, if God impart to him some ray
of his essence, should he not be capable of knowing and of loving
him in the manner in which it shall please him to communicate
himself to us? There must be then an intolerable arrogance
in these sort of arguments, though they seem founded on apparent
humility, which is neither sincere nor reasonable, unless it makes
us confess that not knowing of ourselves what we are, we can
learn it from God alone.</p>

<br />

<p>For myself, I declare that so soon as the Christian religion
reveals the principle that human nature is corrupt and fallen
from God, my eyes are opened to see everywhere the characters
of this truth: for nature is such that she everywhere indicates,
both within man and without him, a God whom he has lost and
a corrupt nature.</p>

<br />

<p>Whatever may be said, it must be conceded that the Christian
religion has something astonishing in it. Perhaps someone will
say: "This is because you were born in it." It may be: then I
stiffen myself against it by this very reason, for fear this prejudice
should bias me; but although I am born in it I cannot but
find it so.</p>

<br />

<p>The whole course of things must have for its object the
establishment and the grandeur of Religion: that there should
be implanted in men sentiments conformable to its precepts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
and in a word, that it should be so completely the aim
and the centre to which all things tend, that whoever understands
its principles can give an explanation as of human
nature in particular, so in general of the whole order of the
world.</p>

<br />

<p>Our religion is wise and foolish. Wise, because it is the most
learned, and the most founded on miracles, prophecies, etc.
Foolish, because it is not all this which causes us to belong to
it; this makes us indeed condemn those who are not of it, but
is not the cause of belief in those who are. It is the cross that
makes them believe, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ne evacuata sit crux</i>. And thus Saint
Paul, who came with wisdom and signs, says that he came neither
with wisdom nor with signs, for he came to convert. But those
who come only to convince may say that they come with wisdom
and with signs.</p>

<br />

<p>That religion, great as she is in miracles, with holy and blameless
Fathers, learned and great witnesses, with martyrs and
kings, as David, and Isaiah, a prince of the blood; great as
she is in science, after having displayed all her miracles and all
her wisdom, rejects it all, and says she has neither wisdom nor
signs, but only the cross and foolishness.</p>

<p>For those, who by these signs and that wisdom have deserved
your belief, and who have proved to you their character, declare
to you that nothing of all this can change you, and render you
capable of knowing and loving God, but the power of the foolishness
of the cross without wisdom and signs, and not the signs
without this power. Thus our Religion is foolish when we consider
the effective cause, wise when we consider the wisdom
which has prepared it.</p>

<br />

<p>How strange is Christianity! It enjoins man to acknowledge
himself vile, even abominable, and enjoins him to aspire to be
like God. Without such a counterpoise, this elevation would
make him horribly vain, or that vileness would make him terribly
abject</p>

<br />

<p>Misery counsels despair, pride counsels presumption.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<br />

<p>The incarnation shows man the greatness of his misery by the
greatness of the remedy of which he stood in need.</p>

<br />

<p>Not a vileness such as renders us incapable of good, nor a
holiness exempt from evil.</p>

<br />

<p>No doctrine is more suited to man than this; for it teaches him
his double capacity of receiving and losing grace, because of the
double peril to which he is always exposed, of despair and of
pride.</p>

<br />

<p>No other religion has enjoined hate of self. No other religion
then can be pleasing to those who hate themselves, and who
seek a Being wholly to be loved. And these, if they had never
heard of the religion of an humiliated God, would embrace it
at once.</p>

<br />

<p>No other has recognised that man is of all creatures the most
excellent. Some, having apprehended the reality of his excellence,
have blamed as mean and ungrateful the low opinion
which men naturally have of themselves, and others, well aware
how real is this vileness, have treated with haughty ridicule
those sentiments of greatness which are no less natural to
man.</p>

<p>"Lift your eyes to God," say these, "see him in whose image
you are, who has made you to worship him. You can make yourselves
like unto him; wisdom will equal you to him if you will
follow it." But others say: "Bend your eyes to the earth, poor
worm that you are, and look upon the brutes your comrades."
What then will man become? Will he equal God or the
brutes? What an awful gulf! What then shall we be? Who
does not see from all this that man has gone astray, that he has
fallen from his place, that he seeks it with disquiet, that he
cannot regain it? And who shall direct him, since the greatest
men have not availed?</p>

<br />

<p>What men could scarcely know by their greatest light, this
Religion has taught to babes.</p>

<br />

<p>Other religions, as those of heathendom, are more popular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
since they consist only in externals, but they have no effect on
the educated. A purely intellectual religion would be more
adapted to the educated, but it would be of no use to the people.
The Christian religion alone is fitted for all, being composed of
externals and internals. It elevates the people to interior acts,
it abases the proud to external rites, and it is not complete without
both, for the people must understand the spirit which is in
the letter, and the educated must submit their spirit to the
letter.</p>

<br />

<p>Philosophers have consecrated vices in attributing them to
God himself, Christians have consecrated virtues.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>OF ORIGINAL SIN.</em></a></h3>
</div>

    <div>

<p class="noindent">There are two truths of faith equally sure: the one, that man
in the state of creation, or in that of grace, is raised above all
nature, is made like unto God and is a sharer in divinity; the
other, that in the state of corruption and sin, he has fallen from
the higher state and is made like unto the beasts. These two
propositions are equally firm and certain. The Scripture declares
it plainly, as when it says in certain places: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Deliciæ meæ,
esse cum filiis hominum. Effundam spiritum meum super
omnem carnem. Dii estis, etc.</i>; and when it says in others:
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Omnis caro fænum. Homo comparatus est jumentis insipientibus,
et similis factus est illis. Dixi in corde meo de filiis
hominum, ut probaret eos Deus et ostenderet similes esse
bestiis, etc.</i></p>

<br />

<p>The wicked, who abandon themselves blindly to their passions,
without the knowledge of God, and without taking the trouble to
seek him, themselves confirm this foundation of the faith which
they attack, that the nature of man is corrupt. And the Jews,
who so obstinately assail the Christian religion, again confirm that
other foundation of the same faith which they assail, namely,
that Jesus Christ is the true Messiah, who has come to redeem
men, and deliver them from the corruption and misery in which
they were, as much by the condition in which we see them at
this day, and which was foretold by the prophets, as by these
same prophecies which they possess and keep so inviolably as
the tokens whereby the Messiah is to be recognised.</p>

<br />

<p>I would ask them if it is not true that they themselves confirm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
this foundation of the faith they assail, which is that the nature
of man is corrupt.</p>

<br />

<p>Marton sees indeed that nature is corrupt, and that men are
opposed to honourable conduct, but he knows not why they
cannot fly higher.</p>

<br />

<p>The meaning of the words <em>good</em> and <em>evil</em>.</p>

<br />

<p>Original sin is foolishness to men, but it is admitted to be so.
This doctrine must not then be reproached with want of reason,
since I admit that it has no reason. But this foolishness is wiser
than all the wisdom of men, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sapientius est hominibus</i>. For
without this how can we say what man is? His whole state
depends on this imperceptible point, and how should it be perceived
by his reason, since it is a thing against reason, and since
reason, far from finding it out by her own ways, revolts from
it when it is offered her?</p>

<br />

<p>There is nothing on earth which does not show either human
misery or divine mercy; either the weakness of man without God,
or the power of man with God.</p>

<br />

<p>Thus the whole universe teaches man, either that he is
corrupt, or that he is redeemed; every thing teaches him his
greatness or his misery; the abandonment by God is shown in
the heathen, the protection of God is shown in the Jews.</p>

<br />

<p>Nature has her perfections to show that she is the image of
God, and her defects to show that she is no more than his
image.</p>

<p>Men being unaccustomed to form merit, but only to recompense
it when they find it formed, judge of God by themselves.</p>

<br />

<p>When we wish to think of God, there is a something which
turns us aside, and tempts us to think on other subjects; all this
is evil and born with us.</p>

<br />

<p>Lust has become natural to us, and has made our second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
nature. Thus there are two natures in us, one good, the other
evil.&mdash;Where is God? Where you are not, and the kingdom of
God is within you.&mdash;<em>The Rabbis.</em></p>

<br />

<p>It is then true that everything instructs man concerning his
condition, but the statement must be clearly understood, for it is
not true that all reveals God, and it is not true that all hides
him. But it is true both that he hides himself from those who
tempt him, and that he reveals himself to those who seek him,
because men are both unworthy and capable of God; unworthy
by their corruption, capable by their original nature.</p>

<br />

<p>We cannot conceive the glorious state of Adam, nor the nature
of his sin, nor the transmission of it to us. These things took
place under the conditions of a nature quite different to our own,
transcending our present capacity.</p>

<p>The knowledge of all this would be of no use in helping us to
escape from it, and all we need know is that we are miserable,
corrupt, separate from God, but ransomed by Jesus Christ, and
of this we have on earth wonderful proofs.</p>

<p>Thus the two proofs of corruption and redemption are drawn
from the wicked, who live indifferent to religion, and from the
Jews who are its irreconcilable enemies.</p>

<br />

<p>All faith consists in Jesus Christ and in Adam, and all morality
in lust and in grace.</p>

<br />

<p>Shall he only who knows his nature know it only to his
misery? Shall he alone who knows it be alone miserable?</p>

<p>He must not see nothing whatever, nor must he see so much
as to believe he possesses it, but he must see enough to know
that he has lost it; for to be aware of loss he must see and not
see, and that is precisely the state in which he is by nature.</p>

<br />

<p>We wish for truth, and find in ourselves only uncertainty.</p>

<p>We seek after happiness, and find only misery and death.</p>

<p>We cannot but wish for truth and happiness, and we are
incapable neither of certainty nor of happiness. This desire is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
left to us, as much to punish us as to make us feel whence we
are drawn.</p>

<br />

<p>Will it be asserted that because men have spoken of righteousness
as having fled from the earth, therefore they knew of
original sin?&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nemo ante obitum beatus est.</i>&mdash;That therefore
they knew death to be the beginning of eternal and essential
happiness?</p>

<br />

<p>The dignity of man while innocent consisted in using and
having dominion over the creatures, but now in separating himself
from them, and subjecting himself to them.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Source of contradictions.</em>&mdash;A God humbled, even to the death
of the cross, a Messiah by his death triumphing over death.
Two natures in Jesus Christ, two advents, two states of human
nature.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Of original sin.&mdash;Ample tradition of original sin according to
the Jews.</em></p>

<p>On the word in Genesis, viii. 21. The imagination of man's
heart is evil from his youth.</p>

<p>R. Moses Haddarschan: This evil leaven is placed in man
from the time that he is formed.</p>

<p><cite>Massechet Succa</cite>: This evil leaven has seven names in Scripture.
It is called evil, an unclean prepuce, an enemy, a scandal,
a heart of stone, the north wind; all this signifies the malignity
which is concealed and ingrained in the heart of man.</p>

<p><cite>Midrasch Tillim</cite> says the same thing, and that God will free
the good nature of man from the evil.</p>

<p>This malignity is renewed every day against man, as it is
written, Psalm xxxvii. The wicked watcheth the just, and
striveth to kill him, but God will not abandon him.</p>

<p>This malignity tries the heart of man in this life, and will
accuse him in the other.</p>

<p>All this is found in the <cite>Talmud</cite>.</p>

<p><cite>Midrasch Tillim</cite> on Ps. iv.: "Stand in awe and sin not."
Stand in awe and be afraid of your lust, and it will not lead you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
into sin. And on Ps. xxxvi. "The wicked has said in his heart:
Let not the fear of God be before me." That is to say that the
malignity natural to man has said that to the wicked.</p>

<p><cite>Misdrasch el Kohelet</cite>: "Better is a poor and a wise child than
an old and foolish king who cannot foresee the future." The
child is virtue, and the king is the malignity of man. It is
called king because all the members obey it, and old because it
is in the heart of man from infancy to old age, and foolish
because it leads man in the way of perdition which he does not
foresee.</p>

<p>The same thing is in <cite>Misdrasch Tillim</cite>.</p>

<p><cite>Bereschist Rabba</cite> on Ps. xxxv.: "Lord, all my bones shall
bless thee, who deliverest the poor from the tyrant." And is
there a greater tyrant than the evil leaven? And on Proverbs
xxv., "If thine enemy be hungry, feed him." That is to say, if
the evil leaven hunger, give him the bread of wisdom of which
speaks Prov. ix., and if he be thirsty, give him the water of which
speaks Isaiah lv.</p>

<p><cite>Misdrasch Tillim</cite> says the same thing, and that the Scripture
in that passage speaking of our enemy, means the evil leaven,
and that in giving it that bread and that water, we heap coals
of fire on his head.</p>

<p><cite>Misdrasch Kohelet</cite> on Ecclesiastes ix. "A great king besieged
a little city." This great king is the evil leaven, the great
engines with which he surrounds it are temptations, and there
has been found a poor wise man who has delivered it, that is to
say virtue.</p>

<p>And on Ps. xli. "Blessed is he that considereth the poor."</p>

<p>And on Ps. lxxviii. The spirit goeth and returneth not again,
whereof some have taken occasion of error concerning the
immortality of the soul; but the sense is that this spirit is the
evil leaven, which accompanies man till death, and will not
return at the resurrection.</p>

<p>And on Ps. ciii. the same thing.</p>

<p>And on Ps. xvi.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>THE PERPETUITY OF THE CHRISTIAN
RELIGION.</em></a></h3>
</div>

     <div>

<p class="noindent"><em>Perpetuity.</em>&mdash;That religion has always existed on earth, which
consists in believing that man has fallen from a state of glory and
of communion with God into a state of sorrow, penitence, and
estrangement from God, but that after this life we shall be
restored by a Messiah who was to come. All things have passed
away, and this has subsisted for which are all things.</p>

<p>Men in the first age of the world were carried away into every
kind of misconduct, and yet there were holy men, as Enoch,
Lamech and others, who awaited with patience the Christ promised
from the beginning of the world. Noah saw the evil of men
at its height; and he was found worthy to save the world in his person,
by the hope of the Messiah of whom he was the type. Abraham
was compassed round about by idolaters, when God revealed
to him the mystery of the Messiah, whom he greeted from afar.
In the days of Isaac and Jacob abomination was spread over the
whole earth, but these holy men lived in faith, and Jacob dying
and blessing his children, cried in a transport which made him
break off his discourse, "I await, O my God, the Saviour whom
thou hast promised. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Salutare tuum expectabo, Domine</i>." The
Egyptians were infected both with idolatry and magic, even the
people of God were led astray by their example. Yet Moses and
others saw him whom they saw not, and adored him, looking
to the eternal gifts which he was preparing for them. The
Greeks and Latins then enthroned false deities, the poets made
a hundred divers theologies, the philosophers separated into a
thousand different sects, and yet in the heart of Judæa were
always chosen men who foretold the advent of this Messiah,
known to them alone. He came at length in the fulness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
time, and since then, notwithstanding the birth of so many
schisms and heresies, so many revolutions in government, such
great changes in all things, this Church, adoring him who has
ever been adored, has subsisted without a break. It is a wonderful,
incomparable and wholly divine fact, that this Religion
which has ever endured, has ever been assailed. A thousand
times has it been on the eve of an universal ruin, and whenever
it has been in that state God has restored it by extraordinary
manifestations of his power. This is marvellous, so also that it
has survived without yielding to the will of tyrants. For it is not
strange that a State subsists when its laws sometimes give way
to necessity, but that....</p>

<p>States would perish if they did not often make their laws bend
to necessity, but Religion has never suffered this or practised it.
And indeed there must be either compromise or miracles. There
is nothing unusual in being saved by yielding, and strictly
speaking this is not endurance, besides in the end they perish
utterly: there is none which has endured a thousand years.
But that this Religion, although inflexible, should always have
been maintained, shows that it is divine.</p>

<br />

<p>The religion which alone is contrary to our nature, to common
sense, and to our pleasures, is that alone which has always
existed.</p>

<br />

<p>The science which alone is contrary to common sense and
human nature, is that alone which has always subsisted among
men.</p>

<br />

<p><em>To show that the true Jews and the true Christians have one
and the same Religion.</em>&mdash;The religion of the Jews seemed to
consist essentially in the fatherhood of Abraham, in circumcision,
sacrifices and ceremonies, in the ark, in the temple at Jerusalem,
and lastly, in the Law, and the Covenant with Moses.</p>

<p>I say that it consisted in none of these, but solely in the love
of God, and that all else was rejected by him;</p>

<p>That God did not accept the posterity of Abraham;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>That the Jews if they transgressed were to be punished like
strangers. Deut. viii. 19. "If thou at all forget the Lord thy
God, and walk after other gods, I testify against you this day
that ye shall surely perish as the nations which God has
destroyed before you."</p>

<p>That strangers if they loved God were to be received by him
as the Jews. Isaiah lvi. 3. "Let not the stranger say, The Lord
will not receive me.&mdash;The strangers that join themselves unto
the Lord God to serve him and love him, will I bring unto my
holy mountain, and accept their sacrifices, for mine house is an
house of prayer."</p>

<p>That the true Jews ascribed all their merit to God, and not to
Abraham. Isaiah lxiii. 16. "Doubtless thou art our Father,
though Abraham be ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledge us
not. Thou art our Father and our Redeemer."</p>

<p>Moses himself said that God would not accept the person of any.</p>

<p>Deut. x. 17. "God," said he, "accepteth neither persons nor
sacrifices."</p>

<p>That the circumcision commanded was that of the heart.
Deut. x. 16; Jeremiah iv. 4. "Be ye circumcised in heart. Cut off
the superfluities of your heart, harden not your hearts, for
your God is a great God, strong and terrible, who accepteth not
the person of any."</p>

<p>That God said he would one day do it. Deut. xxx. 6. "God
will circumcise thine heart, and thy children's heart, that thou
mayest love him with all thine heart."</p>

<p>That the uncircumcised in heart should be judged.</p>

<p>Jer. ix. 26. For God will judge the uncircumcised peoples, and
all the people of Israel, because he is uncircumcised in heart.</p>

<p>That the exterior is nothing in comparison of the interior.
Joel. ii. 13. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Scindite corda vestra</i>, etc. Isaiah lviii. 3,4, etc.</p>

<p>The love of God is commanded in the whole of Deuteronomy,
Deut. xxx. 19: "I call heaven and earth to witness that I have set
before you death and life, that you may choose life, and that you
may love God, and obey him, for God is your life."</p>

<p>That the Jews, for lack of their love, should be rejected for
their crimes, and the Gentiles chosen in their stead.</p>

<p>Hosea i. 10.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>Deut. xxxii. 20. "I will hide myself from them in view of their
latter sins, for they are a froward generation. They have
provoked me to anger by things which are no gods, and I will
provoke them to jealousy by a people which is not my people,
by an ignorant and foolish nation."</p>

<p>Isaiah lxv. 1. That temporal goods are false, and that the
true good is to be united to God.</p>

<p>Psalm cxliii. 15. That their feasts were displeasing to God.</p>

<p>Amos v. 21. That the sacrifices of the Jews were displeasing
to God.</p>

<p>Isa. lxvi. 1-3; l. 11; Jerem. vi. 20.</p>

<p>David, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Miserere</i>. Even on the part of the good, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Expectavi</i>.</p>

<p>Psalm xlix. 8-14. That he has established them only for their
hardness. Micah, admirably, vi. 6-8.</p>

<p>I. Kings xv. 22; Hosea vi. 6.</p>

<p>That the sacrifices of the Gentiles should be accepted of God,
and that God would none of the sacrifices of the Jews. Malachi
i. 11.</p>

<p>That God would make a new covenant with the Messiah, and
that the Old should be disannulled. Jer. xxxi. 31.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mandata non bona.</i> Ezek. xx. 25.</p>

<p>That the old things should be forgotten. Isa. xliii. 18, 19;
lxv. 17, 18.</p>

<p>That the ark should come no more to mind. Jer. iii. 15, 16.</p>

<p>That the temple should be rejected. Jer. vii. 12-14.</p>

<p>That the sacrifices should be rejected, and purer sacrifices
established. Malachi i. 11.</p>

<p>That the order of Aaron's priesthood should be rejected
and that of Melchizedek introduced by the Messiah. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dixit
Dominus.</i></p>

<p>That this sacrifice should be eternal. <em>Ib.</em></p>

<p>That Jerusalem should be rejected, and Rome admitted.</p>

<p>That the name of the Jews should be rejected and a new name
given. Isa. lxv. 15.</p>

<p>That this new name should be more excellent than that of
the Jews, and eternal. Isa. lvii. 5.</p>

<p>That the Jews should be without prophets, Amos, without
a king, without princes, without sacrifice, without an idol.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>That the Jews should nevertheless always remain a people.
Jer. xxxi. 36.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Perpetuity.</em>&mdash;Men have always believed in a Messiah. The
tradition from Adam was still fresh in Noah and in Moses.
After these the prophets bore witness, at the same time foretelling
other things which being from time to time fulfilled in
the eyes of all, demonstrated the truth of their mission, and
consequently that of their promises touching the Messiah.
Jesus Christ worked miracles, and the Apostles also, who converted
all the Gentiles; and the prophecies being thus once
accomplished, the Messiah is for ever proved.</p>

<br />

<p>... On that account I reject all other religions.</p>

<p>In that I find an answer to all objections.</p>

<p>It is just that a God so pure should only disclose himself to
those whose hearts are purified.</p>

<p>Therefore that religion is lovable to me, and I find it sufficiently
authorized by so divine a morality, but I find yet more....</p>

<p>I find it a convincing fact that since the memory of man has
lasted, it was constantly declared to men that they were universally
corrupt, and that a Redeemer should come;</p>

<p>That it was not one man who said it, but an infinity of men,
and a whole nation lasting for four thousand years, prophesying,
and created for that very purpose.... So I stretch out my arms
to my Redeemer, who having been foretold for four thousand
years, has come to suffer and to die for me on earth at the time
and under all the circumstances which had been foretold, and
by his grace I await death in peace, in the hope of being
eternally united to him; yet I live with joy, whether in the good
which it pleases him to bestow on me, or in the ill which he
sends for my good, and which he has taught me to bear by his
example.</p>

<br />

<p>The Synagogue preceded the Church, the Jews preceded the
Christians, the prophets foretold the Christians, Saint John
foretold Jesus Christ.</p>

<br />

<p>No religion but our own has taught that man is born in sin;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
no sect of philosophers ever said this, therefore none has said
the truth.</p>

<p>No sect or religion has always existed on earth, except the
Christian religion.</p>

<br />

<p>The Christian religion is that alone which renders man lovable
and happy at once. Living in the world he cannot be
lovable and happy at the same time.</p>

<br />

<p>In all times either men have spoken of the true God, or the
true God has spoken to men.</p>

<p>There are two foundations, one interior and the other exterior,
grace and miracles, and both are supernatural.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>PROOFS OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION.</em></a></h3>
</div>

    <div>

<p class="noindent"><em>Proofs of Religion.</em></p>

<p>Morals&mdash;Doctrine&mdash;Miracles&mdash;Prophecies&mdash;Figures.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Proof</em>&mdash;1. The Christian religion having established itself
so strongly, yet so quietly, whilst contrary to nature.&mdash;2. The
sanctity, the dignity, and the humility of a Christian soul.&mdash;3.
The wonders of holy Scripture.&mdash;4. Jesus Christ in particular.&mdash;5.
The apostles in particular.&mdash;6. Moses and the prophets
in particular.&mdash;7. The Jewish people.&mdash;8. The Prophecies.&mdash;9.
Perpetuity. No religion has perpetuity.&mdash;10. The Doctrine,
which explains all.&mdash;11. The sanctity of this law.&mdash;12. By the
course of the world.</p>

<p>It is beyond doubt that after considering what is life and
what is religion we cannot refuse to act on the inclination to
follow it, if it comes into our heart, and it is certain there is no
ground for jeering at those who follow it.</p>

<br />

<p><em>The general conduct of the world towards the Church.</em>&mdash;God
willing both to blind and enlighten.&mdash;The event having proved
that these prophecies were divine, the remainder ought to be
believed, and hence we see that the order of the world is on this
manner.</p>

<p>The miracles of the creation and the deluge being forgotten,
God sent the law and the miracles of Moses, the prophets who
prophesied particular things, and to prepare an abiding miracle
he prepares prophecies and their fulfilment. But as the prophecies
might be suspected he wishes to make them beyond
suspicion, etc.</p>

<br />

<p>... But even those who seem most opposed to the glory of
religion are not in that respect useless for others. We draw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
from them the first argument, that here is something supernatural,
for a blindness of that kind is not natural, and if their
folly renders them so opposed to their own good, it will serve
to guarantee others against it, by the horror of an example so
deplorable, and a folly so worthy of compassion.</p>

<br />

<p>... Men revile what they do not understand. The Christian
religion consists in two points. It is of equal moment to men to
know them both, and equally dangerous to ignore either. And
it is equally of God's mercy that he has given marks of both.</p>

<p>Yet they take occasion to conclude that one of these points
does not exist from that which is intended to make them certain
of the other. Those sages who have said there is a God have
been persecuted, the Jews were hated, and still more the
Christians. They saw by the light of nature, that if there
be a true religion on earth, the course of all things must
tend to it as to a centre. And on this ground they venture
to revile the Christian religion because they misunderstand it.
They imagine that it consists simply in the adoration of a God
conceived as great, powerful and eternal; which is in fact
deism, almost as far removed from the Christian religion as
atheism, its exact opposite. And hence they infer the falsehood
of our religion, because they do not see that all things
concur to the establishment of this point, that God does not
manifest himself to man with all the evidence which is possible.</p>

<p>But let them conclude what they will against deism, they can
conclude nothing on that account against the Christian religion,
which properly consists in the mystery of the Redeemer, who,
uniting in himself the two natures human and divine, has withdrawn
men from the corruption of sin that he might in his divine
person reconcile them to God.</p>

<p>True religion then teaches these two truths to men, that there
is a God whom they are capable of knowing, and that there is
such corruption in their nature as to render them unworthy of
him. It is of equal importance to men that they should apprehend
the one and the other of these points, and it is alike dangerous
for man to know God without the knowledge of his own
worthlessness, and to know his own worthlessness without the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
knowledge of the Redeemer who may deliver him from it. To
apprehend the one without the other begets either the pride of
philosophers, who knew God, but not their own wretchedness;
or the despair of atheists, who know their own wretchedness, but
not the Redeemer. And as it is alike necessary for man to
know these two points, so it is alike of the mercy of God to
have given us the knowledge. The Christian religion does this;
it is in this that it consists. Let us herein examine the order of
the world, and see if all things do not tend to establish these
two main points of our Religion.</p>

<br />

<p>It is a remarkable fact that no canonical writer has ever
employed nature to prove God. All tend to make him be believed.
David, Solomon and others have never said: "There is no
vacuum, therefore there is a God." They must have been cleverer
than the cleverest in after days who have all used this argument.</p>

<p>This is well worth considering.</p>

<br />

<p>If it be a mark of weakness to prove God by nature, despise
not the Scripture for not doing so: if it be a mark of power to
know these contradictions, value the Scriptures on that account.</p>

<br />

<p>What! Do you not say yourself that the sky and the birds
prove God?&mdash;No.&mdash;And does not your religion say so?&mdash;No.
For however it may be true in a sense for some souls to
whom God has given this light, it is nevertheless false in regard
to the majority.</p>

<br />

<p>Think you it is impossible that God is infinite, without parts?&mdash;Yes.&mdash;I
will then make you see something which is infinite
and indivisible. A point moving everywhere with infinite swiftness,
for it is in all places, and is whole and entire in each
situation.</p>

<p>Perhaps this effect of nature, which seems to you impossible
beforehand, may teach you to know that there may be others
also which you know not as yet. Do not then draw this conclusion
from your apprenticeship, that nothing remains for you
to know, but rather that an infinity remains for you to know.</p>

<br />

<p>It is incomprehensible that there should be a God, and incomprehensible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
that there should not be; that there should be a soul
in the body, and that we should have no soul; that the world
should have been created, and that it should not, etc.; that
original sin should be, and that it should not be.</p>

<br />

<p>If we choose to say that man is too little to merit communion
with God, we must be indeed great to form a judgment on the
subject.</p>

<br />

<p>The Eternal is for ever, if he is at all.</p>

<br />

<p>But it is impossible that God should ever be the end, if he is
not the beginning. We look above, but lean upon the sand,
and the earth will melt, and we shall fall whilst looking towards
heaven.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Objection.</em> The Scripture is plainly full of matters which were
not dictated by the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em> Then they do no harm to faith.</p>

<p><em>Objection.</em> But the Church has decided that all is of the Holy
Spirit.</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em> I answer two things: 1. That the Church has never
so decided; 2. That if she should so decide it might be maintained.</p>

<br />

<p>My God! what trash is all this talk: "Has God made the
world but to condemn it? will he ask so much of creatures so
weak?" etc. Scepticism is the remedy for this evil, and will
lower this vanity.</p>

<br />

<p>God has willed to redeem mankind and to open salvation to
those who seek him. But men render themselves so unworthy
of it, that it is just that God should refuse to some because of
their hardness of heart what he grants to others out of a mercy
not their due. Had it been his will to overcome the stubbornness
of the most hardened, he could have rendered them unable
to doubt the truth of his essence, in revealing himself manifestly
to them as he will appear at the last day, amid thunderings and
lightnings, and so great a convulsion of nature, that the dead will
rise again, and the blindest shall see him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>Not thus willed he to appear in his gentle advent, because since
so many men make themselves unworthy of his mercy, he
willed to leave them deprived of the good which they refuse. It
had not then been just that he should appear in a manner plainly
divine, and wholly capable of convincing all men, but neither
had it been just that he should come in so hidden a manner as
not to be recognised of those who sincerely sought him. He
has willed to reveal himself wholly to these, and thus willing to
appear openly to those who seek him with their whole heart, and
to hide himself from those who fly him with all their heart, he
has so tempered the knowledge of himself as to give signs of
himself visible to those who seek him, and obscure to those who
seek him not.</p>

<p>There is enough light for those who wish earnestly to see, and
enough obscurity for those of a contrary mind.</p>

<br />

<p>Therefore let men recognise the truth of religion in the very
obscurity of religion, in the little light we have of it, and in our
indifference to the knowledge of it.</p>

<br />

<p>The prophecies, the very miracles and proofs of our Religion,
are not of such a nature that we can say they are absolutely
convincing. But they are also of such a kind, that none can say
that it is unreasonable to believe in them. Thus there is both
evidence and obscurity to enlighten some and blind others;
but the evidence is such that it surpasses or at least equals the
evidence to the contrary, so that it is not reason which can
determine us not to follow it, and therefore it can only be lust
and malice of heart. And by this means there is evidence
enough to condemn, and not enough to convince; so it appears
in those who follow it, that it is grace and not reason which
causes them to follow it; and in those who fly it, it is lust, not
reason, which causes them to fly it.</p>

<br />

<p>Who can help admiring and embracing a religion which
thoroughly knows that which we recognise more and more in
proportion to our light?</p>

<br />

<p><em>That God has willed to hide himself.</em>&mdash;If there were only one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
Religion God would certainly be manifest; so also if there were
no martyrs but in our own Religion.</p>

<p>God being thus hidden, every religion which does not say that
God is hidden is not the true religion, and every religion which
does not show the reason of it is unedifying. Our religion does
all this: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vere tu es Deus absconditus</i>.</p>

<br />

<p>Religion is so great a thing, that it is right that those who will
not take the trouble to seek if it be obscure should be deprived
of it. Why then should any complain, if it be such as to be found
by seeking?</p>

<br />

<p>The obscurity would be too great, if truth had not visible
signs. This is a marvellous one, that it has always been preserved
in a Church and a visible assembly. The clearness would
be too great if there were only one opinion in this Church, but
to recognise what is true is only to see what has always existed,
for it is certain that truth has always existed, and that nothing
false has been always in existence.</p>

<br />

<p>Recognise then the truth of religion even in the obscurity of
religion, in the little light we have of it, and in the indifference
we have to its knowledge.</p>

<br />

<p>God chooses rather to sway the will than the intellect. Perfect
clearness would be useful to the intellect but would harm the
will. To humble pride.</p>

<br />

<p>Were there no obscurity man would not be sensible of his
corruption; were there no light man would despair of remedy.
Thus it is not only just, but useful for us, that God should be
partly hidden and partly revealed, because it is equally dangerous
for man to know God without the knowledge of his
misery, and to know his misery without the knowledge of God.</p>

<br />

<p>If the mercy of God is so great that his teaching is salutary
even when he hides himself, what great light may we not
expect when he reveals himself?</p>

<br />

<p>We shall understand nothing of the works of God if we do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
take it as a principle that he has willed to blind some and
enlighten others.</p>

<br />

<p>What say the prophets of Jesus Christ? That he will be
manifestly God? No: but that he is a God truly hidden, that he
will be misunderstood; that none would think it was he; that
he would be a stone of stumbling on which many would fall, etc.
Let us no longer then be reproached with want of clearness,
since we make profession of it.</p>

<p>But, it is said, there are obscurities.&mdash;And without that, no one
would have stumbled at Jesus Christ, which is one of the formal
announcements of the prophets: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Excæca</i>....</p>

<br />

<p>Instead of complaining that God is hidden, you will give
him thanks for having revealed so much of himself; and you
will give him thanks again for not having revealed himself to
the proudly wise, who are unworthy to know so holy a God.</p>

<p>Two sorts of persons know: those whose heart is humble, and
who love lowliness, whatever their order of intellect, whether
high or low, and those who have understanding enough to see
the truth, whatever opposition they may feel to it.</p>

<br />

<p>I may well love total darkness, but if God keep me in a state
of semi-obscurity, this partial darkness is unpleasant to me, and
because I do not see in it the advantages of total darkness it
pleases me not. This is a fault, and a proof that I am making
an idol of darkness apart from God's order. Now his order
alone is to be worshipped.</p>

<br />

<p>Did the world exist to instruct man concerning God, his
divinity would shine out incontestably from every part of it, but
as it exists only by Jesus Christ, and for Jesus Christ, and to instruct
men concerning their corruption and their redemption,
proofs of these two truths start up everywhere.</p>

<p>What is seen does not denote either the total exclusion or
the manifest presence of divinity, but the presence of a God who
hides himself. All bears this character.</p>

<br />

<p>Had nought of God ever appeared, this eternal deprivation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
would have been equivocal, and might as well be interpreted
of the total absence of divinity, as of man's unworthiness to
know him; but by occasional and not continual appearances he
has taken away all ambiguity. If he have appeared once, he is
for ever, and thus it must be concluded both that there is a God,
and that men are unworthy of him.</p>

<br />

<p>God, that he may reserve to himself alone the right to instruct
us and that he may render the difficulty of our being unintelligible
to us, has hidden the knot so high, or rather so low, that
we cannot reach it. So that it is not by the efforts of our
reason, but by the simple submission of our reason, that we can
truly know ourselves.</p>

<br />

<p>Wisdom sends us to childhood: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nisi efficiamini sicut parvuli</i>.</p>

<br />

<p>"A miracle," says one, "would strengthen my faith." He says
so when he does not see one. Reasons seen from afar seem to
limit our view, but as we reach them we begin to see beyond.
Nothing stops the activity of our spirit. There is no rule, we say,
which has not its exception, no truth so general but that there is
a side on which it is lacking. If it be not absolutely universal,
we have a pretext for applying the exception to the matter in
hand, and for saying: <em>This is not always true, hence there are
cases in which it is not so. It only remains to show that this
is one of them.</em> And we must be very awkward or unlucky if we
do not find one some day.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Contradictions.</em></p>

<p>Infinite wisdom and wisdom of Religion.</p>

<br />

<p>Contradiction is a bad mark of truth.</p>

<p>Much that is certain is contradicted.</p>

<p>Much that is false passes without contradiction.</p>

<p>Contradiction is not a mark of falsehood, nor the want of contradiction
a mark of truth.</p>

<br />

<p>There is a pleasure in being in a vessel beaten about by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
storm, provided we are certain it will not founder. The persecutions
which try the Church are of this kind.</p>

<p>The history of the Church should rightly be called the history
of truth.</p>

<br />

<p>Those who find difficulties of belief seek an excuse in the
unbelief of the Jews. "If it was so clear," say they, "why did
not the Jews believe?" And they almost wish the Jews had
believed, that they might not be deterred by the example of
their refusal. But their very unbelief is the foundation of our
faith. We should be much less disposed to believe if they were
on our side. We should then have a far more ample pretext.
This is the wonderful point, to have made the Jews great lovers
of the things foretold, and great enemies of their accomplishment.</p>

<br />

<p>What could the Jews, his enemies, do? Receiving him they
give proof of him by that reception, for then the Messiah is
acknowledged by those to whom was committed the expectation
of his coming; rejecting him they prove his truth by that
rejection.</p>

<br />

<p><em>On the fact that the Christian Religion does not stand alone.</em>&mdash;This
is so far from being a reason against believing it the true
one that, on the contrary, it proves it to be so.</p>

<br />

<p>Those who love not the truth take as a pretext that it is contested,
and that a multitude deny it; and thus their error
comes from this alone, that they love neither truth nor charity.
So they are without excuse.</p>

<br />

<p>The wicked who profess to follow reason, ought to be extremely
strong in reason.</p>

<p>What then do they say?</p>

<p>Do we not see, say they, beasts live and die like men, and
Turks like Christians? They have their ceremonies, their prophets,
their doctors, their saints, their religious, as well as we,
etc. <em>But how is this contrary to the Scripture? Does it not say
all this?</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>If you care but little to know the truth, here is enough for
your peace. But if you desire to know it with your whole heart,
this is not enough, look to the details. This would suffice for
a question in philosophy, but not here, where your all is concerned.
And yet, after a slight meditation of this kind, we
shall go off to amuse ourselves, etc. We should acquaint ourselves
with this religion; even if it does not disclose the reason
for such obscurity, it will perhaps teach it to us.</p>

<br />

<p>If God had permitted one only Religion, it would have been
too easily recognised. But when we look at it near we can easily
see the true through the confusion.</p>

<p class="noindent"><em>Perpetuity.</em>&mdash;Let it be considered that from the beginning of
the world the expectation or the worship of the Messiah has subsisted
without a break; that there have been men who said that
God had revealed to them the future birth of a Redeemer who
should save his people; that afterwards came Abraham saying he
had had a revelation that the Messiah was to spring from him
by a son who should be born; that Jacob declared that of his
twelve sons the Messiah would spring from Judah; that Moses
and the prophets then came to declare the time and the
manner of his advent; that they said their law was only provisional
till that of the Messiah, that it should last till then
but the other should endure eternally; that thus either their
law or that of the Messiah, of which it was the promise,
would be always upon earth; that in fact it has always endured;
that at last Jesus Christ has come with all the circumstances
foretold. How wonderful is this!</p>

<br />

<p>The two most ancient books in the world are those of Moses
and Job, the one a Jew, the other a Gentile, both of whom
regard Jesus Christ as their common centre and object: Moses
in reporting the promises of God to Abraham, Jacob, etc., and
his prophecies. And Job, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quis mihi det ut, etc. Scio enim quod
redemptor meus vivit, etc.</i></p>

<br />

<p>I believe that Joshua was the first of God's people who had
this name, as Jesus Christ was the last of God's people.</p>

<br />

<p>What man had ever so great renown! The whole Jewish
people foretold him before his coming. The Gentile world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
worships him after his coming. The two worlds, Gentile and
Jewish, regard him as their centre.</p>

<p>Yet what man ever had less enjoyment of his renown! Of thirty-three
years he spent thirty in retirement. For three years he
passed as an impostor, the priests and rulers rejected him, his
friends and kinsmen despised him. At the end he died,
betrayed by one of his own disciples, denied by another,
abandoned by all.</p>

<p>What part then had he in all this renown? Never man had
more glory, never man more ignominy. All this renown was for
our sakes, to enable us to recognise him, he took none of it for
himself.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Office of Jesus Christ.</em>&mdash;He alone was to produce a great people,
elect, holy, and chosen, to lead it, to nourish it, to bring it into a
place of rest and holiness, to make it holy to God, to make it the
temple of God, to reconcile it to God, to save it from the wrath
of God, to deliver it from the slavery of sin, which visibly reigns
in man, to give laws to this people, to engrave these laws on
their heart, to offer himself to God for them, to sacrifice himself
for them, to be a victim without spot, himself the priest, needing
to offer himself, his body and his blood, and yet to offer bread
and wine to God....</p>

<br />

<p>After many persons had come before, at last came Jesus
Christ, to say: "Here am I and this is the hour, that which the
prophets had said was to come in the fulness of time. I tell you
what my apostles will do. The Jews shall be cast out, Jerusalem
shall be soon destroyed, and the Gentiles shall enter into the
knowledge of God. My apostles shall do this after you have
slain the heir of the vineyard."</p>

<p>Then the Apostles said to the Jews, "You shall be accursed,"
and to the Gentiles, "You shall enter into the knowledge of
God;" and that came to pass. <em>Celsus laughed at it.</em></p>

<br />

<p>Then Jesus Christ came to tell men that they had no enemies
but themselves, that their passions cut them off from God, that
he came to destroy these, and give them his grace to unite them
all in an holy Church, that he came to call into this Church Gentiles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
and Jews, that he came to destroy the idols of the former and
the superstition of the latter. To this all men are opposed, not
only by the natural opposition of lust; but above all, the kings
of the earth, as had been foretold, gathered together to destroy
this religion in its infancy. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quare fremuerunt gentes. Reges
terræ adversus Christum.</i></p>

<p>All that was great on earth was united together, the learned,
the wise, the kings. The first wrote, the second condemned,
the last slew. Yet notwithstanding all these oppositions, these
men, so simple and so weak, resisted all these forces, subduing
even the mighty, the learned and the wise, and removed
idolatry from all the earth. And all this was done by the power
which had foretold it</p>

<br />

<p>And prediction crowns all this, so that none may say that
chance has done it all.</p>

<p>Whosoever having only a week to live, does not perceive
that belief is the right side to take, and that all this is not a
stroke of chance....</p>

<p>Now were we not slaves to passion, a week and a hundred
years would seem one and the same thing.</p>

<br />

<p>The prophets foretold, and were not foretold. The saints
were foretold, but were not foretellers. Jesus Christ was foretold
and foreteller.</p>

<br />

<p>If I had never heard anything of the Messiah, yet after the
admirable predictions of the course of the world which I see
accomplished, I see that it is divine. And if I knew that these
same books foretold a Messiah, I should be certain that he would
come. And seeing that they place his time before the destruction
of the second temple, I should say that he had come.</p>

<br />

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ingrediens mundum.</i></p>

<p>Stone upon stone.</p>

<p>That which preceded, that which followed. All the Jews still
exist, and are wanderers.</p>

<br />

<p>Why did not Jesus Christ come in a visible manner, instead
of drawing proof from the prophecies which went before him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>And why did he cause himself to be foretold in figures?</p>

<br />

<p>God, to enable the Messiah to be recognised by the good
and unrecognised by the wicked, caused him to be so foretold.
If the manner of the Messiah had been clearly foretold
there had been no obscurity, even for the wicked. If the time
had been obscurely foretold, there had been obscurity even for
the good, for their goodness of heart would not have made them
understand, for instance, that the closed <em>mem</em> means six hundred
years. But the time has been foretold clearly and the manner
in figures only.</p>

<p>By this means the wicked, mistaking the promised for material
blessings, have gone astray, in spite of clear indications of the
time, and the good have not gone astray; for the interpretation
of the promised blessings depends on the heart, wont to call that
<em>good</em> which it loves, but the interpretation of the promised time
does not depend on the heart. Thus the clear prediction of
the time, and the obscure intimation of the blessings, deceives
only the wicked.</p>

<br />

<p>If Jesus Christ had come only for sanctification, the whole of
Scripture and all things would tend to this end, and it would be
easy to convince unbelievers. If Jesus Christ had come only
to blind, all his conduct would be confused, and we should
have no means of convincing unbelievers. But as he came <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in
sanctificationem et in scandalum</i>, as says Isaiah, we cannot convince
unbelievers, and they cannot convince us; but by that very
fact we overcome them because we say that there is nothing
in his conduct conclusive on one side or the other.</p>

<br />

<p>Jesus Christ has come to blind those who saw clearly, and to
give sight to the blind; to heal the sick and let the sound perish;
to call sinners to repentance and justification, and leave the just
in their sins; to fill the hungry with good things and to send the
rich empty away.</p>

<br />

<p>We can have nothing but veneration for a man who clearly
foretells events which take place, and who declares his design both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
to blind and to enlighten, and who mixes obscurities among the
clear things which happen.</p>

<br />

<p><em>During the life of the Messiah.&mdash;Ænigmatis.</em>&mdash;Ezek. xvii.&mdash;His
forerunner. Malachi ii.</p>

<p>He will be born an infant. Is. ix. 6.</p>

<p>He will be born at Bethlehem. Micah v. He will appear
chiefly in Jerusalem, and will spring from the family of Judah
and of David.</p>

<p>He will blind the learned and the wise, Is. vi 8, 29, and preach
the Gospel to the poor and the lowly, will open the eyes of the
blind, restore health to the sick, and bring light to those who
languish in darkness. Is. lxi.</p>

<p>He must show the perfect way, and be the teacher of the
Gentiles. Is. lv.</p>

<p>The prophecies must be unintelligible to the wicked, Dan. xii.,
Hos. xiv. 10, but intelligible to those who are well instructed.</p>

<p>He must be the precious corner stone. Is. xxviii. 16.</p>

<p>He must be the stone of stumbling and offence. Is. viii.</p>

<p>Jerusalem must dash against this stone.</p>

<p>The builders must reject this stone. Ps. cxvii. 22.</p>

<p>God will make of this stone the head of the corner.</p>

<p>And this stone will grow into a mountain, and fill the whole
earth. Dan. ii.</p>

<p>Thus he must be rejected, disowned, betrayed, sold, Zach. xi.
12, spit upon, buffeted, mocked, afflicted in a thousand ways, be
given gall to drink, Ps. lxviii., pierced, Zach. xii., his feet and
his hands pierced, killed, and lots cast upon his vesture.</p>

<p>He must rise again, Ps. xv., the third day. Hos. vi. 3.</p>

<p>He must ascend to heaven to sit on the right hand. Ps. cx.</p>

<p>The kings will arm themselves against him. Ps. ii.</p>

<p>Being on the right hand of the Father, he will have victory
over all his enemies.</p>

<p>The kings of the earth, and all nations shall worship him.
Is. lx.</p>

<p>The Jews will remain as a nation. Jer.</p>

<p>They will be dispersed, without kings, etc., Hos. iii; without
prophets. Amos;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>Waiting for salvation and finding it not. Is.</p>

<p>The calling of the Gentiles by Jesus Christ. Is. lii., Ps. lxxi.</p>

<br />

<p>The Jews in slaying him that they might not receive the
Messiah, stamped him with the final proof of his Messiahship.</p>

<p>And by continuance in denial, they made themselves unimpeachable
witnesses; and in slaying him, and continuing to
reject him, they have fulfilled the prophecies.</p>

<br />

<p>The word <em>Galilee</em>, which the Jewish rabble pronounced as if
by chance, in their accusation of Jesus Christ before Pilate, gave
Pilate a reason for sending Jesus Christ to Herod, so that the
mystery was accomplished, that he should be judged by Jews and
Gentiles. Chance was apparently the cause that the mystery
was accomplished.</p>

<br />

<p>The conversion of the Gentiles was only reserved for the grace
of the Messiah. The Jews so long opposed them without success;
all that Solomon and the prophets had said was useless. Wise
men like Plato and Socrates could not persuade them.</p>

<br />

<p>If this was so clearly foretold to the Jews, why did they not
believe it, or why were they not exterminated for resisting what
was so clear?</p>

<p>I answer first: it was foretold both that they would not
believe what was so clear, and that they would not be exterminated.
And nothing is more glorious to the Messiah, for it is not enough
that there should be prophets, they must be kept above suspicion.
Now, etc.</p>

<br />

<p>Had the Jews been all converted by Jesus Christ, we should
have none but doubtful witnesses, and had they been entirely
destroyed we should have had no witnesses at all.</p>

<br />

<p>The Jews rejected him, but not all. The saints receive him, but
not carnal men. Yet this is far from being against his glory, it
is the last stroke which perfects it. The argument on their side,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
the only one which is found in the Talmud and the rabbinical
writings, is that Jesus Christ has not subdued the nations sword
in hand, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gladium tuum, potentissime</i>. Is this all they can
allege? Jesus Christ has been slain, they say, he was subdued,
he has not had dominion over the heathen by his power, he has
not distributed the spoil among us, he does not give riches.
Is this all they have to allege? This is the very point wherein
he seems to me so lovable. I would none of such an one as
they represent. It is plain that his life only hinders them from
receiving him, by their refusal they become irreproachable
witnesses, and what is more, they thereby fulfil the prophecies.</p>

<br />

<p>There are those who see clearly that man has no other enemy
than lust, which turns him from God, and not God, and that
there is no other good but God, not a fat land. Let those who
believe that the good of man is in the flesh, and evil that which
turns him away from sensual pleasures, besot themselves
with them and die in them. But those who seek God with their
whole heart, whose only ill is not to see him, whose only desire
is to possess him, whose only enemies are those who would
turn them from him, who are afflicted when they are surrounded
and overwhelmed by such enemies, may take comfort, for I declare
to them this joyful news: there is for them a Redeemer,
whom I will show them; I will show them that there is for
them a God, and I will not show him to others. I will show
them that a Messiah has been promised, who will deliver them
from their enemies, and that one has come to deliver them from
their iniquities, not from their enemies.</p>

<br />

<p>It is a wonderful thing, and worthy of all attention, to see the
Jewish nation existing so many years in constant misery, it
being necessary as a proof of Jesus Christ, both that they should
exist to be his witnesses, and should be miserable because they
crucified him, and though to be miserable and to exist, are
contradictory, this nation still exists in spite of its misery.</p>

<br />

<p>When Nebuchadnezzar carried away the people, for fear they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
should believe that the sceptre had departed from Judah, they
were assured beforehand that they would be but a short time in
captivity, and would be restored.</p>

<p>They were never without the comfort of their prophets, or the
presence of their kings. But the second destruction is without
promise of restoration, without prophets, without kings, without
comfort, without hope, for the sceptre is taken away for ever.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Proofs of Jesus Christ.</em>&mdash;To have been captive with the
assurance of deliverance in seventy years was no true captivity.
But now they are captives without hope.</p>

<p>God has promised them that even though he should disperse
them to the ends of the earth, nevertheless if they were faithful
to the law he would gather them together. They are now very
faithful to it, yet remain oppressed.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Blindness of Scripture.</em>&mdash;The Scripture, say the Jews, says that
we know not whence Christ should come.</p>

<p>John vii. 27 and xii 34.</p>

<p>The Scripture says that Christ abideth for ever, and he said
that he should die. Therefore, says Saint John, they believed him
not, though he had done so many miracles, that the word of
Isaiah might be fulfilled: <em>He hath blinded them, etc.</em></p>

<br />

<p><em>Contradictions.</em>&mdash;The sceptre until Messiah come. Without
king or prince.</p>

<p>The eternal law, changed.</p>

<p>The eternal covenant, a new covenant.</p>

<p>The good law, evil precepts, Ezekiel xx.</p>

<br />

<p>Apparent discord of the Evangelists.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Proofs of Jesus Christ.</em></p>

<p>Why the book of Ruth was preserved.</p>

<p>Why the story of Tamar.</p>

<br />

<p>The genealogy of Jesus Christ in the Old Testament is
intermixed with so many that are useless, that it cannot be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
distinguished. If Moses had kept only the register of the ancestors
of Jesus Christ, that had been too plain. If he had not marked
that of Jesus Christ, it had not been plain enough. But after all,
whoso looks closely sees that of Jesus Christ distinctly traced
through Tamar, Ruth, etc.</p>

<br />

<p>Jesus Christ in an obscurity&mdash;as the world calls obscurity&mdash;so
great, that the historians who wrote only the important matters
of States hardly perceived him.</p>

<br />

<p><em>On the fact that neither Josephus, nor Tacitus, nor other historians,
have spoken of Jesus Christ.</em>&mdash;So far from this being
any argument against, it is rather one for us. For it is certain
that Jesus Christ has existed, that his religion has made a great
noise, and that these people were not ignorant of it; thus
it is plain that they designedly concealed it, or perhaps that
they did speak of it, and what they said has been suppressed or
altered.</p>

<br />

<p>When Augustus learnt that Herod's own son was among the
children under the age of two years whom he had commanded
to be slain, he said that it was better to be Herod's pig than
his son. Macrob. <cite>Saturn</cite>. Lib. ii., c. 4.</p>

<br />

<p>Macrobius, on the Innocents slain by Herod.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Prophecies.</em>&mdash;Great Pan is dead.</p>

<br />

<p>Herod believed to be the Messiah. He had taken away the
sceptre of Judah, but he was not of Judah. This was held by
a considerable sect.</p>

<p>Both Barcoseba and another received by the Jews. And the
rumour which was everywhere in those times. Suetonius,
Tacitus, Josephus.</p>

<p>In what sort should Messiah come, seeing that by him the
sceptre should be eternally in Judah, and at his coming the
sceptre should depart from Judah?</p>

<p>To the end that seeing they should not see, and understanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
they should not understand, nothing could be better
done.</p>

<p>Curse of the Greeks against those who count periods of time.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Proofs of Jesus Christ.</em>&mdash;Jesus Christ said great things so
simply that he seems not to have considered them, and yet so
tersely that it is clear he had considered them. This clearness
joined with simplicity is wonderful.</p>

<br />

<p>Who taught the evangelists the qualities of an entirely heroic
soul, that they should paint it so perfectly in Jesus Christ? Why
did they describe him weak in his agony? Did they not know
how to paint a steadfast death? No doubt they did, for the same
Saint Luke paints the death of Saint Stephen as braver than
that of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>They describe him therefore as capable of fear before the need
of dying came, and then wholly strong.</p>

<p>But when they represent him as so afflicted, it is when he
afflicts himself, and when men afflict him, then is he wholly
strong.</p>

<br />

<p>The style of the Gospel is wonderful in many ways, and in this
among others, that it contains no invectives against the executioners
and enemies of Jesus Christ. The historians do not rail
against Judas, Pilate, nor any of the Jews.</p>

<p>If this modesty of the evangelical writers had been simulated,
as well as many other traits of a beautiful character, and they
had only simulated it to attract observation, even if they had
not dared to draw attention to it themselves, they would not
have failed to procure friends, who would have remarked on
it to their advantage. But as they acted thus without dissimulation,
and from perfectly disinterested motives, they pointed it
out to no one, and I believe that many points of this kind have
never been noticed till now, which is an evidence of how
dispassionately all was done.</p>

<br />

<p>The apostles were either deceived or deceivers. Both hypotheses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
are difficult; for it is not possible to mistake a man raised
from the dead....</p>

<p>While Jesus Christ was with them, his presence might sustain
them, but after that, what gave them force to act if he did not
appear to them?</p>

<br />

<p><em>Proof of Jesus Christ.</em>&mdash;The supposition that the apostles were
deceivers is thoroughly absurd. Suppose we follow it out, and
imagine these twelve men assembled after the death of Jesus
Christ, making a plot to say that he was risen again. By this they
attack all earthly powers. The heart of man is strangely inclined
to fickleness and change, swayed by promises and by wealth.
Had one of these men contradicted themselves under these
temptations, nay more, had they done so in prison, in torture and
in death, they were lost. Let that be followed out.</p>

<br />

<p>Hypothesis that the apostles were deceivers.</p>

<p>The time clearly.</p>

<p>The manner obscurely.</p>

<p>Five typical proofs.</p>

<p class="pad3">1,600 prophets.</p>

<p>2,000</p>

<p class="pad4">400 scattered.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Atheists.</em>&mdash;What reason have they to say it is not possible to
rise again? Which is the more difficult, to be born or to rise
again; that that which has never been should be, or that what
has been should be again? Is it more difficult to come into
being than to return to it? Habit causes the one to seem easy
to us, the want of habit causes the other to seem impossible.
The popular way of judging.</p>

<p>Why should not a virgin bear a child? does not a hen lay
eggs without a cock? What distinguishes these outwardly from
others? and who has told us that the hen may not form the
germ as well as the cock?</p>

<br />

<p>What have they to say against the resurrection, or against the
child-bearing of the Virgin? which is the more difficult; to produce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
a man or an animal, or to reproduce it? And if they had
never seen any species of animal, could they guess that they
were not produced without connection with each other?</p>

<br />

<p>How I hate these follies of not believing in the Eucharist, etc....
If the Gospel be true, if Jesus Christ be God, what difficulty
is there?</p>

<br />

<p>It is impiety not to believe in the Eucharist on the ground
that we do not see it.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>THE MISSION AND GREATNESS OF
JESUS CHRIST.</em></a></h3>
</div>

    <div>

<p class="noindent">We know God only by Jesus Christ. Without this mediator
all communion with God is taken away, by Jesus Christ we
know God. All who have thought to know God, and to prove
him without Jesus Christ, have had but feeble proofs. But for
proof of Jesus Christ we have the prophecies, which are solid
and palpable proofs. And these prophecies, accomplished and
proved true by the event, mark the certainty of these truths, and
consequently the divinity of Jesus Christ. In him then, and by
him we know God; apart from him, and without the Scripture,
without original sin, without a necessary mediator, foretold and
come, we could not absolutely prove God, nor teach sound
doctrine and sound morality. But by Jesus Christ, and in Jesus
Christ we prove God and teach morality and doctrine. Jesus
Christ is then the true God of men.</p>

<p>But we know at the same time our misery, for this God is
none other than he who repairs our misery. Thus we can only
know God well by knowing our sins. Therefore those who
have known God without knowing their misery, have not glorified
him, but have glorified themselves. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quia non cognovit per
sapientiam, placuit Deo per stultitiam prædicationis salvos
facere.</i></p>

<br />

<p>Not only do we know God by Jesus Christ alone, but we know
ourselves by Jesus Christ alone. We know life and death by
Jesus Christ alone. Apart from Jesus Christ we know not what
is our life, nor our death, nor God, nor ourselves.</p>

<p>Thus without the Scripture, which has Jesus Christ alone for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
its object, we know nothing, and see only obscurity and confusion
in the nature of God, and in our own nature.</p>

<br />

<p>Without Jesus Christ man must be plunged in vice and misery;
with Jesus Christ man is free from vice and misery, in him is
all our virtue and all our happiness. Apart from him is nought
but vice and misery, error and darkness, death and despair.</p>

<br />

<p>Without Jesus Christ the world would not exist, for it could
only be either destroyed, or a very hell.</p>

<br />

<p>It is not only impossible but useless to know God without Jesus
Christ. They have not withdrawn from him, but drawn near;
they have not abased themselves, but....</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quo quisque optimus est, pessimus, si hoc ipsum, quod sit
optimus, ascribat sibi.</i></p>

<br />

<p>The Gospel only speaks of the virginity of the Virgin up to
the time of the birth of Jesus Christ. All with reference to Jesus
Christ</p>

<br />

<p>Jesus Christ, whom the two Testaments regard, the Old as its
end, the New as its model, both as their centre.</p>

<br />

<p>Scepticism is the truth. For, after all, men before Jesus Christ
did not know either where they were or if they were great or
little. And those who said one or the other knew nothing about
it, and guessed without reason and by chance, yet they always
erred in excluding one or the other.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quod ergo ignorantes quæritis, Religio annuntiat vobis.</i></p>

<br />

<p>If Epictetus had seen the way with certainty he would have
said to men: "You follow a false road"; he shows that there
is another, but he does not lead there; it is the way of willing
what God wills; Jesus Christ alone leads thither, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">via</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">veritas</i>.</p>

<br />

<p>Jesus Christ did nothing but teach men that they were lovers
of themselves, that they were slaves, blind, sick, miserable, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
sinners, that he would deliver them, enlighten, bless, and
heal them, that this would be brought about by hatred of self,
and by following him through poverty and the death of the
cross.</p>

<br />

<p>An artisan who speaks of riches, a lawyer who speaks of war,
or of kingship, etc., but the rich man rightly speaks of riches, a
king speaks slightingly of a great gift he has just made, and God
rightly speaks of God.</p>

<br />

<p>Hosea iii.</p>

<p>Isaiah xlii, xlviii., liv., lx., lxi. The last verse. I have foretold
it long since, that they might know that it is I.</p>

<p>Jaddus to Alexander.</p>

<br />

<p>Man is not worthy of God, but he is not incapable of being
rendered worthy.</p>

<p>It is unworthy of God to unite himself to miserable man,
but it is not unworthy of God to raise him from his misery.</p>

<br />

<p>The infinite distance between body and mind is a figure of
the infinitely more infinite distance between mind and charity,
for this is supernatural.</p>

<p>All the splendour of greatness has no lustre for those who
seek understanding.</p>

<p>The greatness of men of understanding is invisible to kings,
to the rich, to conquerors, and to all the great according to the
flesh.</p>

<p>The greatness of wisdom, which has no existence save in
God, is invisible to the carnal and to men of understanding.
These are three orders differing in kind.</p>

<p>Men of great genius have their empire, their glory, their
grandeur, their victory, their lustre, and do not need worldly
greatness, with which they have nothing to do. They are seen,
not by the eye, but by the mind; and that is enough.</p>

<p>The saints have their empire, their glory, their victory, their
lustre, and want no glory of the flesh or of the mind, with which
they have nothing to do, for these add nothing to them neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
do they take away. They are seen of God and the angels, and
not by the bodily eye, nor by the curious spirit; God suffices them.</p>

<p>Archimedes without worldly pomp would have had the same
reverence. He fought no battles for the eye to gaze on, but
he left his discoveries to all minds. O! how brilliant was he to
the mind.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ, without riches, and without any exterior manifestation
of science, is in his own order of holiness. He gave
forth no scientific inventions to the world, he never reigned;
but he was humble, patient, holy; holy before God, terrible to
devils, without spot of sin. O! in what great pomp, and with
what transcendent magnificence did he come to the eyes of the
heart, which discern wisdom.</p>

<p>It would have been needless for Archimedes, though of princely
birth, to have played the prince in his books on geometry.</p>

<p>It would have been needless to our Lord Jesus Christ for the
purpose of shining in his kingdom of holiness, to come as kings
come; but he did come in the glory proper to his order.</p>

<p>It is most unreasonable to be offended at the lowliness of Jesus
Christ, as if this lowliness were in the same order as was the
greatness which he came to display. Let us consider this greatness
in his life, in his passion, in his obscurity, in his death, in
the choice of his disciples, in their desertion of him, in the
secrecy of his resurrection, and the rest, and it will seem so vast
as to give no room for offence at a lowliness in another order.</p>

<p>But there are those who can only admire carnal as though
there were no mental greatness, and others who only admire
mental greatness, as though there were not infinitely greater
heights in wisdom.</p>

<p>All bodies, the firmament, the stars, the earth and the kingdoms
thereof, are not comparable to the lowest mind, for mind
knows all these, and itself; the body nothing.</p>

<p>All bodies together and all minds together, and all they can
effect, are not worth the least motion of charity. This is of an
order infinitely more exalted.</p>

<p>From all bodies together, we cannot extract one little thought:
this is impossible and in another order. From all bodies and
minds it is impossible to produce a single motion of true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
charity, it is impossible, it is in another and a supernatural
order.</p>

<br />

<p>The Jews, in testing if he were God, have shown that he was
man.</p>

<br />

<p>The Church has had as much difficulty in showing that Jesus
Christ was man, against those who denied it, as in showing that
he was God. And the evidences were equally great.</p>

<br />

<p>Jesus Christ is a God to whom we draw near without pride,
and before whom we abase ourselves without despair.</p>

<br />

<p>Jesus Christ for all, Moses for a people.</p>

<p>The Jews were blessed in Abraham. "I will bless those that
bless thee." But all nations are blessed in his seed.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Parum est ut</i>, etc. Isaiah.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lumen ad revelationem gentium.</i></p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non fecit taliter omni nationi</i>, said David in speaking of the
Law. But in speaking of Jesus Christ it must be said: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fecit
taliter omni nationi</i>.</p>

<p>So it is the property of Jesus Christ to be universal; even the
Church offers the sacrifice only for the faithful. Jesus Christ
offered that of the cross for all.</p>

<br />

<p>The victory over death. What advantageth it a man that he
gain the whole world and lose his own soul? He that will save
his soul shall lose it.</p>

<p>I am not come to destroy the law, but to fulfil. Lambs
took not away the sins of the world, but I am the lamb who take
away sins. Moses gave you not that bread from heaven. Moses
has not led you out of captivity, and made you truly free.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Types.</em>&mdash;Jesus Christ opened their mind to understand the
Scriptures.</p>

<p>There are two great revelations.</p>

<p>1. All things happened to them in figures: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vere Israelitæ, vere
liberi</i>, true bread from heaven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>2. A God humbled to the cross. It was necessary that Christ
should suffer and enter into glory, that he should conquer death
by death. Two advents.</p>

<br />

<p>The types of the completeness of redemption, as that the
sun gives light to all, denote only completeness, but they figuratively
imply exclusions, as the Jews elected to the exclusion of
the Gentiles denote exclusion.</p>

<br />

<p>Jesus Christ the Redeemer of all.&mdash;Yes, for he has offered,
like a man who has ransomed all who willed to come to him. It
is the misfortune of those who die on the way, but as far as he is
concerned, he offers them redemption.&mdash;That holds good in the
example, where he who ransoms and he who hinders from dying
are two, but not in Jesus Christ, who does both one and the other.&mdash;No,
for Jesus Christ in his quality of Redeemer, is not perhaps
master of all, and thus so far as in him lies, he is the Redeemer
of all.</p>

<br />

<p>Jesus Christ would not be slain without the forms of justice,
for it is much more ignominious to die by justice than by an unjust
sedition.</p>

<br />

<p>The elect will be ignorant of their virtues and the reprobate of
the greatness of their crimes. "Lord, when saw we thee an
hungered or athirst?" etc.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ would none of the testimony of devils, nor of those
who were not called, but of God and John the Baptist.</p>

<br />

<p>Jesus Christ says not that he is not of Nazareth, to leave the
wicked in their blindness; nor that he is not the son of Joseph.</p>

<br />

<p>The calling of the Gentiles by Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>The ruin of the Jews and heathen by Jesus Christ.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>THE MYSTERY OF JESUS.</em></a></h3>
</div>

    <div>

<p class="noindent">Jesus suffered in his passion the torments which men inflicted
on him, but in his agony he suffered torments which he inflicted
on himself: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">turbare semetipsum</i>. This is a suffering from no
human, but an almighty hand, and he who bears it must also
be almighty.</p>

<p>Jesus sought some comfort at least in his three dearest friends,
and they were asleep. He prayed them to watch with him
awhile, and they left him with utter carelessness, having so
little compassion that it could not hinder their sleeping even for
a moment. And thus Jesus was left alone to the wrath of God.</p>

<p>Jesus was without one on the earth not merely to feel and
share his suffering, but even to know of it; he and heaven were
alone in that knowledge.</p>

<p>Jesus was in a garden, not of delight as the first Adam, in
which he destroyed himself and the whole human race; but in
one of agony, in which he saved himself and the whole human
race.</p>

<p>He suffered this sorrow and this desertion in the horror of
night.</p>

<p>I believe that Jesus never complained but on this single occasion,
but then he complained as if he could no longer restrain
his extreme sorrow. "My soul is sorrowful, even unto death."</p>

<p>Jesus sought companionship and consolation from men. This
was the only time in his life, as it seems to me; but he received
it not, for his disciples were asleep.</p>

<p>Jesus will be in agony even to the end of the world. We must
not sleep during that time.</p>

<p>Jesus in the midst of this universal desertion, even that of his
own friends chosen to watch with him, finding them asleep, was
vexed because of the danger to which they exposed, not him, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
themselves; he warned them of their own safety and of their
good, with a heartfelt tenderness for them during their ingratitude,
and warned them that the spirit is willing and the flesh weak.</p>

<p>Jesus, finding them still sleeping, unrestrained by any consideration
for themselves or for him, had the tenderness not to
wake them but to let them sleep on.</p>

<p>Jesus prayed, uncertain of the will of his Father, and feared
death; but so soon as he knew it he went forward to offer himself
to death: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eamus. Processit.</i> John.</p>

<p>Jesus asked of men, and was not heard.</p>

<p>Jesus, while his disciples slept, wrought their salvation. He
has wrought that of each of the just while they slept both in
their nothingness before their birth, and in their sins after their
birth.</p>

<p>He prayed only once that the cup should pass away, and then
with submission; but twice that it should come if need were.</p>

<p>Jesus was weary.</p>

<p>Jesus, seeing all his friends asleep and all his enemies wakeful,
gave himself over entirely to his Father.</p>

<p>Jesus did not regard in Judas his enmity, but God's order,
which he loves and admits, since he calls him friend.</p>

<p>Jesus tore himself away from his disciples to enter into his
agony; we must tear ourselves from our nearest and dearest to
imitate him.</p>

<p>Jesus being in agony and in the greatest sorrow, let us pray
longer....</p>

<p>Console thyself, thou wouldest not seek me hadst thou not
found me.</p>

<p>I thought of thee in mine agony, such drops of blood I shed
for thee.</p>

<p>It is tempting me rather than proving thyself, to think if thou
wouldest act well in a case which has not occurred, I will act
in thee if it occur.</p>

<p>Let my rules guide thy conduct; see how I have led the Virgin
and the saints who have let me act in them.</p>

<p>The Father loves all that I do.</p>

<p>Must I ever shed the blood of my humanity and thou give
no tears?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>Thy conversion is my affair; fear not and pray with confidence
as for me.</p>

<p>I am present with thee by my word in the Scriptures, by my
Spirit in the Church and by inspiration, by my power in the
priest, by my prayer in the faithful.</p>

<p>Physicians will not heal thee, for thou wilt die at last. But it
is I who heal thee and make the body immortal.</p>

<p>Suffer chains and bodily servitude, I deliver thee now only
from what is spiritual.</p>

<p>I am to thee more a friend than such or such an one, for I have
done for thee more than they; they have not borne what I have
borne from thee, they have not died for thee as I have done in
the time of thine infidelities and thy cruelties, and as I am ready
to do and do in my elect and at the Holy Sacrament.</p>

<p>If thou knewest thy sins thou wouldest lose heart.&mdash;I shall lose
it then O Lord, for on thy word I believe their malice.&mdash;No,
for I by whom thou learnest it can heal thee of them, and what
I tell thee is a sign that I will heal thee. As thou dost expiate
them, thou wilt know them, and it will be said to thee: "Behold,
thy sins are forgiven thee!"</p>

<p>Repent then for thy secret sins, and for the hidden malice of
those which thou knowest.</p>

<p>Lord, I give thee all.&mdash;</p>

<p>I love thee more ardently than thou hast loved thine uncleannesses,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ut immundus pro luto</i>.</p>

<p>To me be the glory, not to thee, thou worm of earth.</p>

<p>Ask thy director, when my own words are to thee occasion of
evil, or vanity, or curiosity.</p>

<p>I see the depths which are in me of pride, curiosity and lust.
There is no relation between me and God, nor Jesus Christ the
Just One. But he has been made sin for me, all thy scourges
are fallen upon him. He is more abominable than I, and far
from abhorring me he holds himself honoured that I go to him
and succour him.</p>

<p>But he has healed himself, and still more will he heal me.</p>

<p>I must add my wounds to his, and join me to him, and he will
save me in saving himself.</p>

<p>But this must not be put off to a future day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>Do little things as though they were great, because of the
majesty of Jesus Christ who does them in us, and who lives our
life; do great things as though they were small and easy, because
of his omnipotence.</p>

<br />

<p><em>The Sepulchre of Jesus Christ.</em>&mdash;Jesus Christ was dead, but
seen on the Cross. He was dead, and hidden in the sepulchre.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ was buried by the saints alone.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ worked no miracles at the sepulchre.</p>

<p>Only the saints entered it.</p>

<p>There, not on the Cross, Jesus Christ took a new life.</p>

<p>It is the last mystery of the passion and the redemption.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ had no where to rest on earth but in the
sepulchre.</p>

<p>His enemies only ceased to persecute him at the sepulchre.</p>

<br />

<p>I consider Jesus Christ in all persons and in ourselves. Jesus
Christ as a father in his father, Jesus Christ as a brother in his
brethren, Jesus Christ as poor in the poor, Jesus Christ as rich
in the rich, Jesus Christ as doctor and priest in priests, Jesus
Christ as sovereign in princes, etc. For by his glory he is all that
is great, since he is God; and he is by his mortal life all that is
miserable and abject. Therefore he has taken this wretched
state, to enable him to be in all persons, and the model of
all conditions.</p>

<br />

<p>The false justice of Pilate only caused the suffering of Jesus
Christ; for he caused him to be scourged by his false justice,
and then slew him. It would have been better that he had slain
him at first. Thus is it with those who are falsely just. They do
good works or evil to please the world, and show that they are
not altogether of Jesus Christ, for they are ashamed of him.
Then at last in great temptations and on great occasions, they
slay him.</p>

<br />

<p>It seems to me that Jesus Christ after his resurrection allowed
his wounds only to be touched: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Noli me tangere</i>. We must
unite ourselves to his sufferings only.</p>

<br />

<p>At the Last Supper he gave himself in communion as one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
about to die; to the disciples at Emmaus as one risen from
the dead; to the whole Church as one ascended into heaven.</p>

<br />

<p>Compare not thyself with others, but with me. If thou
findest me not in those with whom thou comparest thyself, thou
comparest thyself with him that is abominable. If thou findest
me there compare thyself to me. But who is it that thou dost
compare? Thyself, or me in thee? If it be thyself it is one
that is abominable; if it be me thou comparest me to myself.
Now I am God in all.</p>

<p>I speak and often counsel thee because thy Guardian can not
speak to thee, for I will not that thou shouldest lack a guide.</p>

<p>And perhaps I do so at his prayers, and thus he leads thee
without thy seeing it.</p>

<p>Thou wouldest not seek me unless thou didst possess me.</p>

<p>Therefore be not troubled.</p>

<br />

<p>Be comforted; it is not from yourself that you must expect it;
but on the contrary, expecting nothing from yourself, you must
await it.</p>

<br />

<p>Pray that ye enter not into temptation. It is dangerous to be
tempted, and those alone are tempted who do not pray.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Et tu conversus confirma fratres tuos.</i> But before, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">conversus
Jesus respexit Petrum</i>.</p>

<p>Saint Peter asked permission to strike Malchus, and struck
before having the answer; Jesus Christ answered afterwards.</p>

<br />

<p>I love poverty because he loved it. I love wealth because it
gives the power of helping the miserable. I keep my troth to
everyone; rendering not evil to those who do me wrong; but
I wish them a lot like mine, in which I receive neither good
nor evil from men. I try to be just, true, sincere, and faithful
to all men; I have a tender heart for those to whom God has
more closely bound me; and whether I am alone or seen of
men I place all my actions in the sight of God, who shall judge
them, and to whom I have consecrated them all.</p>

<p>Such are my opinions, and each day of my life I bless my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Redeemer who has implanted them in me, who has transformed
me, a man full of weakness, misery, and lust, of pride and
ambition, into a man exempt from all these evils, by the power
of his grace, to which all the glory is due; since of myself I have
only misery and sin.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>OF THE TRUE RIGHTEOUS MAN AND<br /><br />
OF THE TRUE CHRISTIAN.</em></a></h3>
</div>

    <div>

<p class="noindent"><em>Members. To begin with that.</em>&mdash;To regulate the love which we
owe to ourselves, we must imagine a body full of thinking members,
for we are members of the whole, and see how each
member should love itself, etc....</p>

<br />

<p>If the feet and the hands had each a separate will they could
only be in their order in submitting this separate will to the
primary will which governs the whole body. Apart from that
they are in disorder and misfortune, but in willing only the good
of the body they find their own good.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Morality.</em>&mdash;God having made the heavens and the earth, which
cannot feel the happiness of their being, he has been pleased to
make beings who should know it, and who should compose a
body of thinking members. For our members do not feel the
happiness of their union, of their admirable intelligence, of the
care which nature has taken to infuse into them a mind, and to
make them grow and endure. How happy would they be if they
could see and feel it. But in order to this they must needs have
intelligence to know it, and good will to consent to that of the
universal soul. For if, having received intelligence, they used it
to retain nourishment for themselves without allowing it to pass
to the other members, they would be not only unjust but also
miserable, and would hate rather than love themselves, their
blessedness as well as their duty consisting in their consent to
the guidance of the general soul to which they belong, who loves
them better than they love themselves.</p>

<br />

<p>To be a member, is to have neither life, being, nor movement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
save by the spirit of the body, and for the body; the separate
member, seeing no longer the body to which it belongs, has
only a waning and dying existence. Yet it believes it is a whole,
and seeing not the body on which it depends, it believes it
depends only on self and wills to constitute itself both centre and
body. But not having in itself a principle of life, it only goes
astray, and is astonished in the uncertainty of its being; fully
aware that it is not a body, yet not seeing that it is a member
of a body. Then when at last it arrives at the knowledge of
self, it has returned as it were to its own home, and loves itself
only for the body's sake, bewailing that in the past it has gone
astray.</p>

<p>It cannot by its nature love aught else, if not for itself and to
subject it to self, since each thing loves itself above all. But in
loving the body it loves itself, because it has no being but in it,
by it, and for it. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Qui adhæret Deo unus spiritus est.</i></p>

<p>The body loves the hand, and the hand, if it had a will, should
love itself in the same proportion as that in which it is loved by
the soul. All love beyond this is unjust.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Adhærens Deo unus spiritus est.</i> We love ourselves because
we are members of Jesus Christ. We love Jesus Christ because
he is the body of which we are members. All is one, one is in
the other, like the Three Persons.</p>

<br />

<p>The examples of the noble deaths of the Lacedæmonians and
others scarce touch us, for what good do they to us? But the
example of the death of the martyrs touches us, for they are our
members. We have a common tie with them, their resolution
can form ours, not only by example, but because it has perhaps
merited ours. There is nothing of this in the examples of the
heathen; there is no bond between us. As we do not become
rich by seeing a rich stranger, but by seeing a father or a husband
who is so.</p>

<br />

<p>We must love God only, and hate self only.</p>

<p>If the foot had always been ignorant that it belonged to the
body, and that there was a body on which it depended, if it had
only had the knowledge and the love of self, and if it came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
know that it belonged to a body on which it depended, what regret,
what confusion for the past life, for having been useless to
the body from which its whole life was derived, which would have
reduced it to nothing if it had rejected it and separated it from
itself, as it held itself apart from the body. What prayers for its
preservation in the body, with what submission would it allow
itself to be governed according to the will which rules the body,
even to consent, if need be, that it should be cut off, or it would
lose its character of member. For each member must be
content to perish for the body, for which alone the whole exists.</p>

<br />

<p>To ensure the happiness of the members, they must have one
will, and submit it to the body.</p>

<br />

<p>It is false that we are worthy of the love of others, it is unjust
that we should desire it. If we were born reasonable and impartial,
knowing ourselves and others, we should not give this
bias to our will. But we are born with it; we are therefore
born unjust, for all tends to self. This is contrary to all order.
We should look to the general advantage, and the inclination to
self is the beginning of all disorder, in war, in politics, in
economy, and in man's own body.</p>

<p>The will therefore is depraved. If the members of natural and
civil communities tend towards the well-being of the body, the
communities themselves should tend to the welfare of another
more general body of which they are members. We should
therefore look to the whole. We are therefore born unjust and
depraved.</p>

<br />

<p>He who hates not in himself his self-love, and that instinct
which leads him to make himself a God, is indeed blinded. All
must see that nothing is so opposed to justice and truth. For
it is false that we deserve this, and it is unjust and impossible
to attain it, since all demand the same. Manifestly then injustice
is innate in us, from which we cannot free ourselves, yet
from which we ought to free ourselves.</p>

<p>But no religion has pointed out that this is a sin, or that
we are born in it, or that we are bound to resist it, or has thought
of offering us a cure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<br />

<p>It is unjust that any should attach themselves to me, even
though they do it with pleasure, and voluntarily. I should
deceive those in whom I aroused this desire, for I am not the
final end of any, nor have I that which can satisfy them. Am I
not about to die? And thus the object of their attachment will
die. Thus as it would be blameworthy in me to cause a falsehood
to be believed, though I should gently insinuate it, though
it should be believed with pleasure, and though it should give me
pleasure; in like manner it is blameworthy in me if I make
myself beloved, and if I draw persons to attach themselves to
me. I ought to warn those who are ready to consent to a lie, that
they should not believe it, whatever advantage accrues to me
from it; and in the same way that they should not attach themselves
to me; for they ought to spend their life and their pains
in pleasing God, or in seeking him.</p>

<br />

<p>Self-will never will be satisfied, though it should have power
for all it would; but we are satisfied from the moment we
renounce it. Without it we cannot be discontented, with it
we cannot be content.</p>

<br />

<p>To hate self, and to seek a truly lovable being to love, is therefore
the true and only virtue, for we are hateful because of lust.
But as we cannot love what is outside us, we must love a being
which is in us, yet not ourselves, and that is true of each and all
men. Now the universal Being is alone such. The Kingdom of
God is within us; the universal good is within us, is our very
selves, yet not ourselves.</p>

<br />

<p>If there be a God we ought to love him alone, and not the
creatures of a day. The reasoning of the wicked in the <cite>Book of
Wisdom</cite> is only founded on the non-existence of God. "Given
that there is no God," say they, "let us take delight in the
creature. It is because there is nothing better." But were there
a God to love they would not have come to this conclusion, but
to the contrary. And this is the conclusion of the wise: "There
is a God, therefore we ought not to take delight in the creature."</p>

<p>Therefore all that leads us to attach ourselves to the creature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
is evil, because it hinders us from serving God if we know him,
and from seeking him if we know him not. Now we are full of
lust. Therefore we are full of evil, therefore we should hate ourselves
and all which urges us to attach ourselves to aught but
God only.</p>

<br />

<p>That we must love one God only is a thing so plain, that no
miracles are needed to prove it.</p>

<p>That is a good state of the Church in which it is upheld by
God alone.</p>

<br />

<p>Two laws suffice to regulate the whole Christian republic better
than all political laws.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Against those who trusting in the mercy of God live carelessly,
without doing good works.</em>&mdash;As the two sources of our sins are
pride and indolence, God has revealed to us two of his attributes
for their cure, mercy and justice. The property of justice
is to abase our pride, however holy may be our works, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">et non
intres in judicium, etc.</i>; and the property of mercy is to
combat indolence by exciting to good works, according to that
passage: "The goodness of God leads to repentance," and
that other of the Ninevites: "Let us do penance to see if peradventure
he will pity us." Thus mercy is so far from authorising
slackness, that it is on the contrary the quality which
formally assails it, so that instead of saying: "Were there not
mercy in God, we must make every effort after virtue," we should
say, on the contrary, that because there is mercy in God we must
make every effort.</p>

<br />

<p>The world exists for the exercise of mercy and judgment, not
as if men were in it as they came from the hands of God, but
as the enemies of God, to whom he gives by grace light enough to
return, if they will seek him and follow him, and to punish them,
if they refuse to seek him and follow him.</p>

<br />

<p>We implore the mercy of God, not that he may leave us in
peace in our vices, but that he may free us from them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<br />

<p>There are but two kinds of men, the righteous, who believe
themselves sinners, and sinners, who believe themselves righteous.</p>

<br />

<p><em>There are two kinds of men in each religion.</em>&mdash;Among the
heathen, worshippers of beasts, and the worshippers of the one
God revealed by natural religion.</p>

<p>Among the Jews, the carnal and the spiritual, who were the
Christians of the old law.</p>

<p>Among the Christians, those coarser ones, who are the Jews of
the new law.</p>

<p>The carnal Jews looked for a carnal Messiah, and the coarser
Christians believe that the Messiah has dispensed them from the
love of God. True Jews and true Christians adore a Messiah
who makes them love God.</p>

<br />

<p>Carnal Jews and the heathen have their miseries, and Christians
also. There is no Redeemer for the heathen, for they do
not even hope for one. There is no Redeemer for the Jews,
who hope for him in vain. There is a Redeemer only for the
Christians.</p>

<br />

<p>The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, pride, etc.</p>

<p>There are three orders of things: the flesh, the spirit, and the
will.</p>

<p>The carnal are the rich and kings, who have the body as their
object.</p>

<p>Enquirers and men of science, who have mind for their object.</p>

<p>The wise, who have right for their object.</p>

<p>God must reign over all, and all must be referred to him. In
things of the flesh lust reigns especially, in men of intellect
curiosity especially, in wisdom pride especially.</p>

<p>Not that a man may not boast of wealth or knowledge, but
there is no room for pride, for in granting that a man is learned
there will be no difficulty in proving to him that he is wrong to
be proud. Pride finds its proper place in wisdom, for it cannot
be granted to a man that he has made himself wise and that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
is wrong to be proud of it. For that is just. Now God alone
gives wisdom, and therefore <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">qui gloriatur in Domino, glorietur</i>.</p>

<br />

<p>All that is in the world is the lust of the flesh, the lust of the
eyes, or the pride of life; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">libido sentiendi, libido sciendi, libido
dominandi</i>. Woe to the accursed land which these three rivers
of flame enkindle rather than moisten. Happy they who are
on these rivers, not overwhelmed nor carried away, but immovably
fixed upon the floods, not standing, but seated, and on a
firm and sure base, whence they rise not before the dawn; but
where, having rested in peace, they stretch forth their hands
to him who will lift them up, and cause them to stand firm and
upright in the porches of the heavenly Jerusalem, where pride
may no more assail nor cast them down; and who yet weep, not
to see all those perishable things crumble which the torrents
sweep away, but at the remembrance of their dear country, that
heavenly Jerusalem, which they remember without ceasing while
the days of their exile are prolonged.</p>

<br />

<p>The rivers of Babylon rush and fall and sweep away.</p>

<p>O holy Sion, where all is firm and nothing falls.</p>

<p>We must sit upon the floods, not under them or in them, but
on them; not standing but seated, being seated to be humble,
and above them in security. But in the porches of Jerusalem
we shall stand.</p>

<p>Let us see if our pleasure is stable or transitory, if it pass away,
it is a river of Babylon.</p>

<br />

<p>There are few true Christians, I say this even in regard to faith.
There are many who believe, but from superstition. There are
many who believe not, out of reckless living; few are between
the two.</p>

<p>I do not include here those whose morality is true holiness,
nor those whose belief springs from the heart.</p>

<br />

<p>It is not a rare thing to have to blame the world for too much
docility, it is a vice as natural as unbelief, and as pernicious.
Superstition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<br />

<p>Abraham took nothing for himself, but only for his servants;
so the just man takes for himself nothing of the world, nor of the
applause of the world, but only for his passions, which he uses as
their master, saying to the one, 'Go,' and to another, 'Come.'
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sub te erit appetitus tuus.</i> The passions thus subdued are virtues.
God himself attributes to himself avarice, jealousy, anger; and
these are virtues as well as kindness, pity, constancy, which are
also passions. We must treat them as slaves, and leaving to
them their food hinder the soul from taking any of it. For
when the passions gain the mastery they are vices, then they
furnish nutriment to the soul, and the soul feeds on it and is
poisoned.</p>

<br />

<p>The just man acts by faith in the smallest things; when he
blames his servants, he wishes for their conversion by the spirit
of God, and prays God to correct them; for he expects as much
from God as from his own blame, and he prays God to bless his
corrections. And so with all his other actions.</p>

<br />

<p>Of all that is in the world he takes part only in what is unpleasant,
not in what is pleasant. He loves his neighbours, but
his charity does not restrict itself within these bounds, but
flows out to his enemies, and then to those of God.</p>

<br />

<p>This is common to ordinary life and that of the saints, that
all endeavour after happiness, and differ only in the object in
which they place it. Both call those their enemies who hinder
them from attaining it.</p>

<p>We should judge of what is good or bad by the will of God,
who cannot be either unjust or blind; and not by our own will,
which is always full of malice and error.</p>

<br />

<p>Joh. viii. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Multi crediderunt in eum. Dicebat ergo Jesus: "Si
manseritis..., vere mihi discipuli eritis, et veritas liberabit
vos." Responderunt: Semen Abrahae sumus et nemini servimus
unquam.</i></p>

<p>There is a great difference between disciples and true disciples.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
They are recognised by saying to them that the truth will
make them free; for if they answer that they are free, and that
it is in their power to come out of slavery to the devil, they
are indeed disciples, but not true disciples.</p>

<br />

<p>"Might I but see a miracle," men say, "I would become a
Christian." How can they be sure they would do that of which
they are ignorant? Men imagine that conversion consists in
making of the worship of God such a transaction and way of
life as they picture to themselves. True conversion consists in
the annihilation of self before that universal Being whom we have
so often provoked, and who might with justice destroy us at any
moment; in recognising that we can do nought without him,
and have merited nothing from him but his wrath. It consists
in knowing that there is unconquerable opposition between us
and God, and that without a mediator there could be no communion
with him.</p>

<br />

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Comminutum cor.</i> Saint Paul. There is the Christian character.
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Albe vous a nommé, je ne vous connais plus.</i> Corneille.
That is the inhuman character. The human character is the
contrary.</p>

<br />

<p>With how little pride a Christian believes himself united to
God, with how little abasement does he rank himself with the
worms of earth. What a way is this to receive life and death,
good and evil.</p>

<br />

<p>It is true there is difficulty in entering into a devout life, but this
difficulty does not arise from the religion which begins in us, but
from the irreligion which is still there. If our senses were not
opposed to penitence, and if our corruption were not opposed to
the purity of God, there would be nothing in this painful to us.
We suffer only in proportion as the vice which is natural to
us resists supernatural grace; our heart feels torn asunder by
these conflicting efforts, but it would be most unjust to impute
this violence to God, who draws us, instead of attributing it to
the world, which holds us back. As a child which a mother
tears from the robbers' arms, in the anguish it suffers should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
love the loving and legitimate violence of her who procures its
liberty, and detest only the imperious and tyrannical violence of
those who retain it unjustly. The most cruel war which God can
make against men in this life is to leave them without that war
which he came to bring. "I came to bring war," he says, and
to inform them of this war, "I came to bring fire and the sword."
Before him the world lived in a false peace.</p>

<br />

<p>The exterior must be joined to the interior to obtain aught
from God, that is to say, we must kneel, pray with the lips, etc.,
in order that proud man, who would not submit himself to God,
should now be subject to the creature. To expect succour from
these externals is superstition, to refuse to join them to interior
acts is pride.</p>

<br />

<p><em>External works.</em>&mdash;There is nothing so perilous as that which
is pleasing to God and to man; for those conditions which are
pleasing to God and man, have one side which is pleasing to
God, and another which is pleasing to man; as the greatness
of Saint Theresa. That which was pleasing to God was her
profound humility under her revelations, what was pleasing to
men was her light. And thus we torment ourselves to imitate
her discourses, thus thinking to imitate her condition, and thereby
to love what God loves, and to place ourselves in a state which
God loves.</p>

<p>It is better not to fast, and be thereby humbled, than to fast
and be puffed up therewith.</p>

<p>The pharisee and the publican.</p>

<br />

<p>What will memory avail me if it be alike hurtful and helpful,
since all depends upon the blessing of God, who gives only to
things done for him according to his rules and in his ways, the
manner being thus as important as the thing, and perhaps more;
since God can bring good out of evil, and because without God
we bring evil out of good.</p>

<br />

<p>The hope which Christians have of possessing an infinite
good is mingled with actual enjoyment as well as with fear; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
it is not as with those who should hope for a kingdom, of which
they being subjects would have nothing; but they hope for
holiness, and freedom from injustice, of which they possess
somewhat.</p>

<br />

<p>None is so happy as a true Christian, none so reasonable,
none so virtuous, none so amiable.</p>

<br />

<p>We remove ourselves from God only by removing ourselves
from love.</p>

<p>Our prayers and our virtues are abomination before God if they
are not the prayers and the virtues of Jesus Christ. And our
sins will never be the object of the mercy, but of the justice of
God, if they are not those of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>He has adopted our sins, and has admitted us into covenant
with him, for virtues are his own, and sins are strange to him;
while virtues are strange to us, and sins are our own.</p>

<p>Let us change the rule which we have hitherto adopted for
judging what is good. We have had our own will as our rule
in this respect, let us now take the will of God, all that he wills
is good and right to us, all that he wills not is evil.</p>

<p>All that God allows not is forbidden; sins are forbidden by the
general declaration that God has made, that he allows them not.
Other things which he has left without general prohibition, and
which for that reason are said to be permitted, are nevertheless
not always permitted; for when God removes any one of them
from us, and when, by the event, which is a manifestation of the
will of God, it appears that God allows not that we should have
a thing, that is then forbidden to us as sin, since the will of God
is that we should not have one more than the other. There is
this sole difference between these two things, that it is certain God
will never allow sin, while it is not certain that he will never
allow the other. But so long as God allows it not, we must look
upon it as sin, so long as the absence of God's will, which alone
is all goodness and all justice, renders it unjust and evil.</p>

<br />

<p>True Christians nevertheless submit to folly, not because they
respect folly, but the commandment of God, who for the punishment
of men has put them in subjection to their follies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Omnis creatura subjecta est vanitati. Liberabitur.</i> Thus Saint
Thomas explains the passage in Saint James on giving place to
the rich, that if they do it not in the sight of God the commandment
of religion is set at naught.</p>

<br />

<p>All great amusements are dangerous to the Christian life, but
among all those which the world has invented none is so much
to be feared as the theatre. It is so natural and so delicate a
representation of the passions that it moves them, and makes
them spring up in our heart, above all that of love, principally
when it is represented as very chaste and very honourable.
For the more innocent it seems to innocent souls, the more are
they capable of being touched by it; its violence pleases our
self-love, which at once forms the desire of causing the same
effects which we see so well represented, and at the same time
we make for ourselves a conscience founded on the honour of
the feelings which we see there. And this extinguishes the fear
of pure souls which imagine there is no harm to purity in loving
with a love which seems to them so moderate.</p>

<p>Thus we leave the theatre with our heart so full of all the
beauty and tenderness of love, the soul and the mind so persuaded
of its innocence, that we are fully prepared to receive its
first impressions, or rather to seek occasion to let them be born
in the heart of some one, in order that we may receive the same
pleasures and the same sacrifices which we have seen so well
depicted in the theatre.</p>

<br />

<p>The circumstances in which it is easiest to live according to
the world are those in which it is most difficult to live according
to God, and <em>vice versâ</em>. Nothing is so difficult according to the
world as the religious life; nothing is more easy according to
God. Nothing is easier than to live in great office and great
wealth according to the world; nothing is more difficult than
to live in them according to God, and not to take part in them
and love them.</p>

<br />

<p>Those who believe without having read the Old and New
Testaments, do so because they have a saintly frame of mind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
with which all that they hear of our Religion agrees. They
feel that a God has made them; their will is to love God only,
their will is to hate themselves only. They feel that they have
no power of themselves, that they are unable to come to God,
and if God come not to them, they can have no communion with
him. And they hear our Religion declare that men must love
God only, and hate self only, but that all being corrupt, and
unfit for God, God made himself man to unite himself to us.
No more is needed to convince men who have such a disposition
and have a knowledge of their duty and of their incompetence.</p>

<br />

<p>Those whom we see to be Christians without the knowledge
of the prophecies and evidences, are able to judge of their religion
as well as those who have that knowledge. They judge of
it by the heart, as others by the understanding. God himself
inclines them to believe, and thus they are effectually persuaded.</p>

<p>I admit that one of those Christians who believe without
proof is not perhaps qualified to convince an infidel who will
say the same of himself; but those who know the proofs of
religion can prove without difficulty that such a believer is truly
inspired by God, though he cannot prove it himself.</p>

<p>For God having said by his prophets, who are beyond a doubt
prophets, that in the reign of Jesus Christ he will spread his
spirit abroad among all nations, that the young men and
maidens and the children of the Church will prophesy, there
is no doubt that the spirit of God is upon these, and not upon
the others.</p>

<br />

<p>Wonder not to see simple souls believe without reasoning.
God gives to them the love of him, and the hate of self, he
inclines their heart to belief. No man will ever believe with
true and saving faith if God incline not the heart, but each will
believe as soon as he inclines it And this is what David knew
well: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Inclina cor meum, Deus, in testimonia tua</i>.</p>

<br />

<p>Romans iii. 27: Boasting is excluded, by what law? Of
works? no, but by that of faith. Therefore faith is not in our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
power, like the works of the law, and it is given us in another
way.</p>

<br />

<p>Faith is a gift of God, do not suppose us to say it is a gift of
reason. Other religions do not say this of their faith, they proffered
only reason as a means of attaining to it, which after all
does not lead to it.</p>

<br />

<p>Faith, it is true, says what the senses do not say, but not the
contrary of what they perceive. It is above them, not contrary
to them.</p>

<br />

<p>I am envious of those whom I see professing the true faith,
but living and abusing a gift of which it seems to me I should
make a very different use.</p>

<br />

<p>The law imposed what it did not bestow; grace bestows that
which it imposes.</p>

<br />

<p>The law has not destroyed Nature, but has instructed it; grace
has not destroyed the law, but has called it into action.</p>

<p>Faith received at baptism is the source of the whole life of the
Christian and of the converted.</p>

<br />

<p>We make an idol of truth itself, for truth apart from charity is
not God, it is his image and idol, which we must neither love
nor adore; still less must we love and adore its opposite, which
is falsehood.</p>

<br />

<p>Submission and use of reason, in which consists true Christianity.</p>

<br />

<p>The last process of reason is to recognise that there is an
infinity of things which transcend it; it is but weak if it does
not go so far as to know that.</p>

<p>And if natural things transcend it, what shall we say of the
supernatural?</p>

<br />

<p><em>Submission.</em>&mdash;We must know when to doubt, when to feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
certain, when to submit. Who fails in this understands not the
force of reason. There are those who offend against these three
rules, either by accepting everything as evidence, for want of
knowing what evidence is; or by doubting everything, for want
of knowing when to submit; or by yielding in everything,
for want of knowing when to use their judgment.</p>

<br />

<p>There are three means of belief; reason, habit, inspiration.
The Christian religion, which only has reason, does not admit
as her true children those who believe without inspiration; not
that she excludes reason or habit, rather the contrary, but it is
necessary to open the mind to proofs, to confirm ourselves by
habit, and then to offer ourselves humbly to inspiration, which
alone can produce a true and salutary effect. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ne evacuetur crux
Christi.</i></p>

<br />

<p>There are two ways of urging the truths of our religion;
one by the force of reason, the other by the authority of the
speaker.</p>

<p>We use not the last, but the first. We do not say: "You must
believe this, for the Scripture which says so is divine," but we
say: You must believe for such and such a reason, which are
weak arguments, since reason bends itself to all.</p>

<br />

<p>If we submit all to reason our religion will have nothing in it
mysterious or supernatural. If we violate the principles of reason,
our religion will be absurd and ridiculous.</p>

<br />

<p>Saint Augustine. Reason would never submit if it did not
judge that on some occasions submission is a duty.</p>

<p>It is then right that it should submit, when it judges that it
ought to submit.</p>

<br />

<p>Piety is different from superstition.</p>

<p>To carry piety as far as superstition is to destroy it.</p>

<p>Heretics reproach us with this superstitious submission. This
is to do that with which they reproach us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>There is nothing so conformable to reason as the disavowal of
reason.</p>

<p>Two excesses: to exclude reason, and to admit reason only.</p>

<br />

<p>Superstition and lust. Scruples, evil desires, evil fear.</p>

<p>Fear, not such as arises from a belief in God, but that which
springs from doubt whether he is or is not. True fear comes
from faith, false fear from doubt. True fear is allied to hope,
because it is born of faith, and because men hope in the God in
whom they behave; false fear is allied to despair, because they
fear the God in whom they do not believe. The one class fears
to lose him, the other fears to find him.</p>

<br />

<p>A person said to me one day that when he came from confession
he felt great joy and confidence. Another said to me that
he was still fearful, whereupon I thought that these two together
would make one good man, and that each was so far wanting in
that he had not the feelings of the other. The same is often
true in other matters.</p>

<br />

<p>The knowledge of God is very far from the love of him.</p>

<br />

<p>We are not wearied of eating and sleeping every day, because
hunger and drowsiness are renewed; without that we should be
weary of them. Thus without the hunger of spiritual things we
grow weary of them. Hunger after righteousness, the eighth
beatitude.</p>

<br />

<p>The conduct of God, who disposes all things gently, is to put
religion into the mind by reason, and into the heart by grace.
But to will to put it into the mind and heart by force and menace
is not to put religion there, but terror, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">terrorem potius quam
religionem</i>.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>THE ARRANGEMENT.</em></a></h3>
</div>

    <div>

<p><em>First part</em>: Misery of man without God.</p>

<p><em>Second part</em>: The happiness of man with God.</p>

<p>Or. <em>First part</em>: That Nature is naturally corrupt.</p>

<p><em>Second part</em>: That the Scripture shows a Redeemer.</p>

<br />

<p><em>The arrangement by dialogues.</em>&mdash;What ought I to do? I see
only obscurity everywhere. Shall I believe that I am nothing,
shall I believe that I am God?</p>

<p>All things change and succeed each other.&mdash;You are mistaken;
there is....</p>

<br />

<p>A letter to lead to the search after God.</p>

<p>And then to cause him to be sought for among the philosophers,
sceptics and dogmatists, who trouble all who seek them.</p>

<br />

<p>To pity those atheists who seek, for are they not unhappy
enough?&mdash;To rail against those who make a boast of it.</p>

<br />

<p>To begin by pitying unbelievers, they are miserable enough
by their condition. We ought not to revile them except where
it may be serviceable, but it does them harm.</p>

<br />

<p><em>The arrangement.</em> A letter of advice to a friend to lead him to
seek, and he will answer: What is the good of seeking, since
nothing comes to light.&mdash;Then to answer him: "Do not despair."&mdash;And
he will answer that he would be glad to find some light,
but that according to this very Religion, thus to believe, will
be of no use to him: and that therefore he would as soon not
seek. And to answer to that: The machine.</p>

<br />

<p><em>The arrangement.</em> After the letter <em>that we ought to seek God</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
to write the letter on <em>the removal of obstacles</em>; which is the discourse
on the machine, on preparing the machine, on seeking
by reason.</p>

<br />

<p><em>The letter which shows the use of proofs by the machine.</em>
Faith is different from proof; the one is human, the other the
gift of God. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Justus ex fide vivit.</i> It is this faith that God himself
puts into the heart, of which the proof is often the instrument,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fides ex auditu</i>; but this faith is in the heart, and makes us say
not <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scio</i>, but <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">credo</i>.</p>

<br />

<p>In the letter <em>on Injustice</em> may come the absurdity of the rule
that the elder takes all. My friend, you were born on this side
the mountain, it is therefore just that your elder brother should
take all.</p>

<br />

<p><em>The arrangement.</em>&mdash;Why should I take on myself to divide my
moral qualities into four rather than into six? Why should I
rather establish virtue in four, in two, in one? Why into <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Abstine
et sustine</i> rather than into <em>Follow nature</em>, or, <em>Conduct your private
affairs without injustice</em>, as Plato, or anything else?</p>

<p>But there, you will say, is everything contained in one word.
Yes, but that is useless, if not explained, and when we begin to
explain it, as soon as the precept is opened which contains all
the others, they issue in that first confusion which you wished to
avoid. Thus when they are all enclosed in one they are concealed
and useless, as in a box, and never appear but in their natural
confusion. Nature has established them all without enclosing
one in the other.</p>

<br />

<p><em>The arrangement.</em>&mdash;Men despise Religion, they hate it, and
fear it may be true. To cure this we must begin by showing
that Religion is not contrary to reason; then that it is venerable,
to give respect for it; then to make it lovable, to make good men
hope that it is true; then to show that it is true.</p>

<p>Venerable because it knows man well, lovable because it promises
the true good.</p>

<br />

<p><em>The arrangement.</em>&mdash;I should be far more afraid of making a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
mistake myself, and of finding that the Christian religion was
true, than of not deceiving myself in believing it true.</p>

<br />

<p><em>The arrangement.</em>&mdash;<em>After</em> corruption to say: "It is right that
those who are in that state should know it, both those who are
contented with it, and those who are discontented; but it is not
right that all should see Redemption."</p>

<br />

<p><em>The arrangement.</em>&mdash;To see what is clear and indisputable in
the whole state of the Jews.</p>

<br />

<p>To the chapter on <em>Fundamentals</em> must be added that on
<em>Things figurative</em> touching the reason of types. Why Jesus
Christ was foretold at his first coming, why foretold obscurely
as to the manner.</p>

<br />

<p>A letter, on the folly of human knowledge and philosophy.</p>

<p>This letter before <em>Diversion</em>.</p>

<br />

<p><em>The arrangement.</em>&mdash;I might well have taken this discourse in
some such order as the following: To show the vanity of
every state of life, to show the vanity of ordinary lives, and
then the vanity of philosophic lives, sceptics, stoics; but the
order would not have been kept. I know a little what it is,
and how few people know it. No human science can keep it.
Saint Thomas did not keep it. Mathematics keep it, but these
are useless by reason of their depth.</p>

<br />

<p>Without examining each particular occupation it will be
enough to class them under Diversion.</p>

<p class="noindent"><em>The beginning.</em>&mdash;Miracles are the test of doctrine, and doctrine
is the test of miracles.</p>

<p>Of these there are false and true. There must be a mark
whereby to know them, or they would be useless.</p>

<p>Now they are not useless, and are on the contrary fundamental
Now it must be that the rule which he gives us be such
as shall not impair the proof afforded by true miracles to the
truth, which is the principal end of miracles.</p>

<p>Moses has given two; that the prediction does not come to
pass, Deut. xviii., and that they do not lead to idolatry, Deut.
xiii.; and Jesus Christ one.</p>

<p>If doctrine regulate miracles, miracles are useless for doctrine.</p>

<p>If miracles regulate....</p>

<p><em>Objection to the rule.</em></p>

<p>Discrimination between times. One rule in Moses's day,
another at present.</p>

<br />

<p>Miracle. An effect which exceeds the natural force of the
means employed, and non-miracle an effect not exceeding the
natural force of the means employed. Thus those who heal by
invocation of the devil work no miracle, for that does not
exceed the natural power of the devil But....</p>

<p>No one has ever suffered martyrdom for the miracles he says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
he has seen; the folly of men would perhaps go as far as
martyrdom, for those which the Turks believe by tradition, but
not for those they have seen.</p>

<br />

<p>Were there no false miracles there would be certainty.</p>

<p>Were there no rule to test them, miracles would be useless,
and there would be no reason for belief.</p>

<p>Now, humanly speaking, there is no human certainty, but
reason.</p>

<br />

<p>It is said: <em>Believe the Church</em>, but it is not said: <em>Believe in
Miracles</em>, because the last is natural and not the first. The one
had need of a precept, not the other.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Miracles.</em>&mdash;How I hate those who make men doubt of miracles.
Montaigne speaks of them as he should in the two passages. In
one we see how careful he is, yet in the other he believes, and
laughs at unbelievers.</p>

<p>However it may be, the Church has no proofs if they are right.</p>

<p>The ground of disbelief in true miracles is want of charity.

<p>The foundation of religion. This is miracle. Does God then
speak against miracles, against the foundations of the faith
which we have in him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>If there be a God, faith in God must exist on earth. Now
the miracles of Jesus Christ are not foretold by Antichrist, but
the miracles of Antichrist are foretold by Jesus Christ. Thus if
Jesus Christ were not the Messiah he would have certainly led
into error, but Antichrist could not certainly lead into error.</p>

<p>When Jesus Christ foretold the miracles of Antichrist, did he
think of destroying faith in his own miracles?</p>

<p>Moses foretold Jesus Christ, and commanded to follow him;
Jesus Christ foretold Antichrist, and forbade to follow him.</p>

<p>It was impossible that in the time of Moses any should assert
their faith in Antichrist, who was unknown to them, but it is easy
in the time of Antichrist to believe in Jesus Christ, already
known.</p>

<p>There is no reason to believe in Antichrist which there is not
to believe in Jesus Christ, but there are reasons for believing in
Jesus Christ, which do not exist for the other.</p>

<p><em>Title: How it happens that men believe so many liars, who
say they have seen miracles, and do not believe any of those who
say they have secrets to make men immortal or render them young
again.</em>&mdash;Having considered how it happens that men have believed
so many impostors, who pretend they have remedies, often to the
length of putting their lives into their hands, it appears to me that
the true cause is that there are true remedies. For it would not
be possible there should be so many false, to which so much
credence is given, were there none true. Were there no remedy
for any evil, and were all diseases incurable, it is impossible that
men should ever have imagined that they could give remedies,
and still more impossible that so many others should have believed
those who boasted that they had them. Just as if a man boasted
that he could prevent death, no one would believe him because
there is no example of this. But as there are a number of remedies
which are approved as true, even by the knowledge of the
greatest men, the belief of men is thereby inclined; and since the
thing was known to be possible, it has been therefore concluded
that it was. For the public as a rule reasons thus: A thing is
possible, therefore it is; because the thing cannot be denied
generally, since there are particular effects which are true, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
people, who cannot discriminate which among particular effects
are true, believe them all. This is the reason that so many
false effects are attributed to the moon, because there are some
true, such as the tide.</p>

<p>It is the same with prophecies, miracles, divination by
dreams, casting lots, etc. For if in all these matters nothing
true had ever taken place, nothing of them had ever been
believed; and so instead of concluding that there are no true
miracles, because so many are false, we must on the contrary
say that there are certainly true miracles because there are
false, and that the false only exist because some are true. We
must reason in the same way about Religion, for it would not be
possible that men should have imagined so many false religions
had there not been one that is true. The objection to this is that
savages have a religion, but we answer that they have heard
speak of the true, as appears by the deluge, circumcision, Saint
Andrew's cross, etc.</p>

<br />

<p>Having considered how it comes that there are so many false
miracles, false revelations, castings of lots, etc., it has appeared
to me that the real cause is that there are true ones, for it would
not be possible that there should be so many false miracles unless
there were true, nor so many false revelations unless there
were true, nor so many false religions unless there were one that
is true. For if all this had never been, it is impossible that men
should have imagined it, and still more impossible that so many
others should have believed it. But as there have been very
great things which are true and as they have been believed by
great men; this impression has been produced, that almost everybody
has been made capable of believing the false also; and
thus instead of concluding that there are no true miracles since
there are so many false, we must on the contrary say that there
are true miracles since there are so many false, and that false
miracles only exist for the reason that there are true; so also
that there are false religions only because there is one that is
true.&mdash;The objection to this is that savages have a religion.
But this is because they have heard speak of the true, as appears
by Saint Andrew's cross, the deluge, the circumcision, etc.&mdash;This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
comes from the fact that the spirit of man, finding itself inclined
to that side by truth, becomes therefore susceptible of all the
falsehoods of that....</p>

<br />

<p>I should not be a Christian were it not for the miracles, said
Saint Augustine.</p>

<br />

<p>But for the miracles there would have been no sin in not
believing in Jesus Christ.</p>

<br />

<p>It is not possible to believe reasonably against miracles.</p>

<br />

<p>Miracles have so great a force that it was needful that God
should warn us not to credit them against him, clear as it
may be that there is a God; without this they would have been
able to disturb.</p>

<p>And thus so far from these passages, Deut. xiii., making
against the authority of miracles, nothing more marks their force.
The same with Antichrist; "to seduce if it were possible even
the very elect."</p>

<br />

<p>Abraham and Gideon are above revelation.</p>

<p>The Jews blinded themselves in judging of miracles by the
Scripture. God has never left his true worshippers.</p>

<p>I prefer to follow Jesus Christ than any other, because he
has miracle, prophecy, doctrine, perpetuity, etc.</p>

<p>The Donatists. No miracle which obliged them to say it was
the devil.</p>

<p>The more we specialise God, Jesus Christ and the Church.</p>

<br />

<p>Jesus Christ worked miracles, then the apostles, and the early
saints in great number, because the prophecies not being yet
fulfilled, but only in the way of fulfilment by them, miracles
were their only witness. It was foretold that the Messiah should
convert the nations, and this prophecy could not be fulfilled
without the conversion of the nations. Nor could the nations
be converted to Messiah unless they saw the final effect of the
prophecies concerning him. Till therefore he died and rose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
again, and had converted the nations, all was not fulfilled, wherefore
miracles were needed during that time. We now need no
more miracles against the Jews, for the fulfilment of prophecy
is an enduring miracle.</p>

<br />

<p>Prophecy is not called <em>miracle</em>, as Saint John speaks of the
first miracle in Cana, then of what Jesus Christ said to the
woman of Samaria, revealing to her all her hidden life. Then
he healed the centurion's son, and Saint John calls this the
second sign.</p>

<br />

<p>Jesus Christ has verified that he was the Messiah, never in
verifying his doctrine by Scripture and the prophecies, but
always by his miracles.</p>

<p>He proves by a miracle that he remits sins.</p>

<p>Rejoice not that you work miracles, said Jesus Christ, but
rather that your names are written in heaven.</p>

<p>If they believe not Moses, neither will they believe one risen
from the dead.</p>

<p>Nicodemus recognised by his miracles, that his doctrine was
of God. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Scimus quia venisti a Deo, magister, nemo enim potest
facere quæ tu facis, nisi Deus fuerit cum eo.</i> He judged not of the
miracles by the doctrine, but of the doctrine by the miracles.</p>

<br />

<p>Here is no country for truth, she wanders unknown among
men. God has covered her with a veil which leaves her unrecognised
by those who hear not her voice; the way is open
for blasphemy even against those truths which are at the least
very apparent. If the truths of the Gospel are published, the
contrary is also published, and questions are obscured, so that
the people cannot discern, and they ask us, "What have you to
make you believed rather than others? what sign do you give?
you have words only, so have we, if you have miracles, good."
That doctrine must be supported by miracle is a truth of which
they make a pretext to blaspheme against doctrine. And if
miracles happen, it is said that miracles are not enough without
doctrine, and that is another way of blaspheming against miracles.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ healed the man born blind, and worked many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
miracles on the sabbath day, and thus he blinded the Pharisees
who said that miracles must be tested by doctrine.</p>

<p>"We have Moses, but as for this man, we know not whence
he is." It is wonderful that you know not whence he is, and yet
he works such miracles.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ spoke neither against God, nor against Moses.</p>

<p>Antichrist and the false prophets foretold by both Testaments,
will speak openly against God, and against Jesus Christ, who is
not hidden. Whoever will be a secret enemy, God will not permit
that he work miracles openly.</p>

<p>In a public dispute where the two parties declare themselves
on the side of God, of Jesus Christ, or the Church, there have
never been miracles on the side of the false Christians, while
the other party has remained without miracle.</p>

<p>"He hath a devil," John x. 21. "And others said, Can a devil
open the eyes of the blind?"</p>

<p>The proofs which Jesus Christ and the Apostles draw from
Scripture are not decisive, for they say only that Moses foretold
that a prophet would come; but they do not thereby prove
that Jesus Christ was that prophet, which is the whole question.
These passages, then, serve only to show that we are not contrary
to Scripture, and that there is no contradiction, not that
there is accord. Now this is enough, there is no contradiction;
and there are miracles.</p>

<p>It follows, then, that he judged miracles to be certain proofs of
what he taught, and that the Jews were bound to believe him.
And as a fact, it was the miracles especially which made the
unbelief of the Jews so blameworthy.</p>

<p>There is a reciprocal duty between God and men. We must
forgive him this saying: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quid debui</i>. "Accuse me," said God in
Isaiah.</p>

<p>God must accomplish his promises, etc.</p>

<p>Men owe it to God to receive the Religion which he sends
them. God owes it to men not to lead them into error. Now
they would be led into error, if the workers of miracles should
announce a doctrine which did not appear visibly false to the
light of common sense, and if a greater worker of miracles had
not already given warning not to believe in them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus if there were division in the Church, and the Arians, for
example, who no less than Catholics said they were founded
on Scripture, had worked miracles, and the Catholics had
worked none, men had been led into error.</p>

<p>For, as a man, who announces to us the secret things of God
is not worthy to be believed on his private testimony, and on
that very ground the wicked doubt him; so when a man as a sign
of the communion which he has with God raises the dead, foretells
the future, moves the seas, heals the sick, there is none so
wicked as not to yield, and the incredulity of Pharaoh and the
Pharisees is the effect of a supernatural hardening.</p>

<p>When, therefore, we see miracles and doctrine not open to
suspicion both on one side, there is no difficulty. But when we
see miracles and suspicious doctrine on the same side we must
see which is the clearest. Jesus Christ was suspected.</p>

<p>Barjesus was blinded. The power of God is above that of his
enemies.</p>

<p>The Jewish exorcists were beaten by devils, who said, "Jesus
we know, and Paul we know, but who are ye?"</p>

<p>Miracles are for doctrine, and not doctrine for miracles.</p>

<p>But if miracles are true we cannot persuade men of all doctrine,
for that will not come to pass: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Si angelus</i>....</p>

<p><em>Rule.</em> We must judge of doctrine by miracles, we must judge
of miracles by doctrine. All this is true, but there is no contradiction.</p>

<p>For we must distinguish the times.</p>

<p>You are glad to know general rules, thinking by that to introduce
difficulties, and render all useless. We shall stop you, my
good father; truth is one, and strong.</p>

<p>It is impossible from the duty God owes us, that a man, concealing
his evil doctrine, and only allowing the good to appear,
pretending that he is in conformity with God and the Church,
should work miracles to insinuate insensibly a false and subtle
doctrine. This cannot be.</p>

<p>Still less, that God who knows the heart, should work miracles
in favour of such an one.</p>

<br />

<p>There is much difference between temptation and leading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
into error. God tempts, but he leads not into error. To tempt
is to present occasions which impose no necessity; if we love
not God we shall do a certain thing. To lead into error, is to
place a man in a necessity of forming and following false conclusion.</p>

<br />

<p>This is what God cannot do, which nevertheless he would do,
if in an obscure question he wrought miracles on the side of
falsehood.</p>

<br />

<p>In the Old Testament, when they would turn you from God,
in the New when they would turn you from Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Such are the occasions on which we exclude certain miracles
from credence. There need be no other exclusions.</p>

<p>But it does not therefore follow that they had the right to exclude
all the prophets who came to them. They would have sinned in
not excluding those who denied God, and would also have
sinned in excluding those who denied him not.</p>

<p>So soon, then, as we see a miracle we should at once either
acquiesce or have signal marks against it. We must see if
it denies either a God, or Jesus Christ, or the Church.</p>

<br />

<p>Miracles avail not for conversion, but for condemnation.

<br />

<p>The Church has three kinds of enemies, the Jews, who have
never been of her body; the heretics, who have withdrawn from
it; and bad Christians, who rend her from within.</p>

<p>These three different kinds of enemies generally assail her in
different ways, but here they assail her in the same fashion. As
they are all without miracles, and as the Church has always had
miracles against them, they have all had the same interest in
eluding them; and all avail themselves of this pretext, that we
must not judge of doctrine by miracles, but of miracles by
doctrine. There were two parties among those who heard Jesus
Christ, those who followed his doctrine by reason of his miracles;
others who said.... There were two parties in the time of
Calvin. There are now the Jesuits, etc.</p>

<br />

<p>Miracles are the test in doubtful matters, between Jew and
Gentile, Jew and Christian, catholic and heretic, slanderer and
slandered, between the two crosses.</p>

<p>But miracles would be useless to heretics, for the Church,
authorised by miracles which have already obtained credence,
tells us that they have not the true faith. There is no doubt
that they are not in it, because the first miracles of the Church
exclude belief in theirs. Thus there is miracle against miracle,
and the first and greatest are on the side of the Church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Controversy.</em> Abel, Cain;&mdash;Moses, the Magicians;&mdash;Elijah,
the false prophets;&mdash;Jeremiah, Hananiah;&mdash;Micaiah, the false
prophets;&mdash;Jesus Christ, the Pharisees;&mdash;Saint Paul, Barjesus;&mdash;the
Apostles, the Exorcists;&mdash;the Christians and the infidels;&mdash;Catholics,
heretics;&mdash;Elijah, Enoch, Antichrist.</p>

<p>In the trial by miracles truth always prevails. The two
crosses.</p>

<br />

<p>Miracles are no longer needful, because they have already been.
But when we listen no more to tradition, when the pope alone is
proposed to us, when he has been taken by surprise, and when
the true source of truth, which is tradition, is thus excluded,
the pope, who is its guardian, is thus prejudiced, truth is no
longer allowed to appear; then, since men speak no longer of
truth, truth herself must speak to men. This is what happened
in the time of Arius.</p>

<br />

<p>Religion is adapted to every kind of intellect. Some consider
only its establishment, and this Religion is such that its very
establishment is enough to prove its truth. Some trace it as far
as the apostles; the more learned go back to the beginning of
the world; the angels see it better still, and from earlier time.</p>

<br />

<p>1. Objection. <em>An angel from heaven.</em></p>

<p>We must not judge of truth by miracles, but of miracles by
truth.</p>

<p>Therefore miracles are useless.</p>

<p>Now they serve, and cannot be against the truth.</p>

<p>Therefore what Father Lingende says, that God will not allow
a miracle to lead into error....</p>

<p>When there shall be a dispute in the same Church, miracle
will decide.</p>

<p>2. Objection.</p>

<p><em>But Antichrist will work miracles.</em></p>

<p>The Magicians of Pharaoh did not lead into error. Thus on
Antichrist we cannot say to Jesus Christ: You have led me into
error. For Antichrist will work them against Jesus Christ, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
thus they cannot lead into error. Either God will not permit
false miracles, or he will procure greater.</p>

<p>If in the same Church a miracle should occur on the side of
those in error, men would be led into error.</p>

<p>A schism is visible, a miracle is visible. But a schism is more
a mark of error than a miracle is a mark of truth, therefore a
miracle cannot lead into error.</p>

<p>But apart from schism the error is not so visible as the miracle
is visible.</p>

<p>Therefore miracle may lead into error.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ubi est Deus tuus?</i>&mdash;Miracles show him and are a light to him.</p>

<p>Joh. vi. 26. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non quia vidisti signum, sed quia saturati estis.</i></p>

<p>Those who follow Jesus Christ because of his miracles honour
his power in all the miracles which it produces. But those who,
making profession to follow him because of his miracles, only
follow him indeed because he consoles them and satisfies them
with worldly goods, disparage his miracles when they are contrary
to their own convenience.</p>

<p>Joh. ix: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non est hic homo a Deo, quia sabbatum non custodit</i>.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Alii: Quomodo potest homo peccator hæc signa facere?</i></p>

<p>Which is the most clear?</p>

<p>This house is not of God, for they do not there believe that
the five propositions are in Jansenius.</p>

<p>Others: This house is of God, for in it strange miracles are
done.</p>

<p>Which is the most clear?</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tu quid dicis? Dico quia propheta est.&mdash;Nisi esset hic a Deo,
non poterat facere quidquam.</i></p>

<br />

<p>There is much difference between not being for Jesus Christ,
and saying it, and not being for Jesus Christ, yet feigning to be
so. The one party can work miracles, not the others, for it is
clear that the one party are against the truth, but not that the
others are; and thus miracles are the more clear.</p>

<br />

<p>"If you believe not in me, believe at least in the miracles."
He puts them forward as the strongest.</p>

<p>He had said to the Jews as well as to the Christians, that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
should not always believe the prophets; but nevertheless the
pharisees and scribes made much of his miracles, and tried to
show that they were false or worked by the devil, since they
were bound to be convinced, if they admitted that these were of
God.</p>

<br />

<p>We are not in these days obliged so to discriminate. Yet it
is very easy to do so; those who deny neither God nor Jesus
Christ work no miracles which are not quite certain.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nemo facit virtutem in nomine meo, et cito possit de me male
loqui.</i></p>

<p>But we have not to use this discrimination. Here is a sacred
relic, here is a thorn from the crown of the Saviour of the
world, on whom the prince of this world has no power, which
works miracles by the immediate power of the blood that was
shed for us. Thus God has himself chosen this house wherein
openly to show forth his power.</p>

<p>Here are not men who work miracles by an unknown and
doubtful virtue, obliging us to a difficult discrimination; it is
God himself, it is the instrument of the passion of his only Son,
who being in many places chose this, and made men come from
all sides, there to receive miraculous succour in their weaknesses.</p>

<br />

<p>If the devil were to favour the doctrine which destroys him,
he would be divided against himself, as Jesus Christ said. If
God favoured the doctrine which destroys the Church, he would
be divided against himself. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Omne regnum divisum.</i></p>

<p>For Jesus Christ acted against the devil, and destroyed his
empire over the heart, of which exorcism is the figure, to establish
the kingdom of God. And so he adds: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Si in digito Dei,
regnum Dei ad vos</i>.</p>

<p>Either God has confounded the false miracles or he has foretold
them, and both by the one and the other he has raised
himself above the supernatural in regard to us, and has raised
us also.</p>

<br />

<p>Jer. xxiii. 32. The <em>miracles</em> of the false prophets. In the Hebrew
and Vatable they are called <em>trifles</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Miracle</em> does not always mean miracle. 1 Kings xiv. 15.
<em>Miracle</em> signifies <em>fear</em>, and is the same in Hebrew.</p>

<p>The same plainly in Job xxxiii. 7.</p>

<p>So in Isaiah xxi. 4. Jeremiah xliv. 12.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Portentum</i> means <em>images</em>, Jer. l. 38, and it is the same in
Hebrew and Vatable. Isaiah viii. 18. Jesus Christ says that
he and his will be in <em>miracles</em>.</p>

<br />

<p>Jesus Christ said that the Scriptures bear witness of him, but
he did not show in what respect.</p>

<p>Even the prophecies could not prove Jesus Christ during his
life, and thus if miracles had not sufficed without doctrine, men
would not have been blameworthy who did not believe in him
before his death. Now those who did not believe in him during
his life were sinners, as he says himself, and without excuse.
Therefore they must have resisted a conclusive proof. Now
they had not our proof, but only miracles, therefore miracles
are enough when doctrine is not contrary, and they ought to
be believed.</p>

<p>John vii. 40. <em>Controversy among the Jews as among Christians
of our day.</em> The one party believed in Jesus Christ, the other
believed not, because of the prophecies which said he should be
born in Bethlehem. They should have enquired more diligently
whether he was not. For his miracles being convincing, they
ought to have been quite certain of these alleged contradictions
of his doctrine to the Scripture, and this obscurity did not
excuse, but blinded them. Thus those who refuse to believe
miracles in our day on account of an alleged but unreal contradiction,
are not excused.</p>

<p>When the people believed on him because of his miracles, the
pharisees said: "This people, which doeth not the law, is
accursed, but there is none of the princes or the pharisees who

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>JESUITS AND JANSENISTS.</em></a></h3>
</div>

    <div>

<p class="noindent">The Church has always been assailed by contrary errors, but
perhaps never at the same time, as now; and if she suffer more
because of the multiplicity of errors, she receives this advantage
from it, that they destroy each other.</p>

<p>She complains of both, but much the most of the Calvinists,
because of the schism.</p>

<p>It is certain that many of the two opposite parties are deceived;
they must be disabused.</p>

<p>Faith embraces many truths which seem contradictory. <em>There
is a time to laugh, and a time to weep, etc.</em> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Responde, ne respondeas,
etc.</i></p>

<p>The source of this is the union of the two natures in Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>And also the two worlds. The creation of a new heaven and
a new earth, a new life, a new death, all things double, and the
same names remaining.</p>

<p>And finally, the two natures which are in the righteous man, for
they are the two worlds, and a member and image of Jesus Christ.
And thus all the names suit them, righteous, sinners; dead
though living, living though dead, elect, reprobate, etc.</p>

<p>There are then a great number of truths in faith and in morals,
which seem contrary to each other, which yet all subsist together
in a wonderful order.</p>

<p>The source of all heresies is the exclusion of some of these
truths.</p>

<p>And the source of all the objections made by heretics against
us is the ignorance of some of these truths.</p>

<p>And for the most part it happens that, unable to conceive the
relation of two opposite truths, and believing that admission of
one involves the exclusion of the other, they embrace the one
and exclude the other, thinking that we on the other hand....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
Now exclusion is the cause of their heresy, and ignorance that we
hold the other truth causes their objections.</p>

<p>1st example: Jesus Christ is God and man. The Arians,
unable to reconcile these things which they believe incompatible,
say that he is man, and so far they are Catholics. But they deny
that he is God, and so far they are heretics. They assert that
we deny his humanity, and so far they are ignorant</p>

<p>2nd example, on the subject of the Holy Sacrament. We
believe that the substance of bread being changed, and consubstantially
that of the body of our Lord Jesus Christ is
therein really present. That is one truth. Another is that this
sacrament is also a figure of that of the cross and of glory, and
a commemoration of the two. That is the Catholic faith, which
comprehends these two truths which seem opposed.</p>

<p>The heresy of our day, not conceiving that this sacrament
contains at one and the same time both the presence of Jesus
Christ and a figure of his presence, that it is a sacrifice and a
commemoration of a sacrifice, believes that neither of these
truths can be admitted without, by this very reason, the exclusion
of the other.</p>

<p>They adhere to this only point, that this sacrament is figurative,
and so far they are not heretics. They think that we exclude
this truth, hence it comes that they found so many objections
on those passages of the Fathers which assert it. Lastly they
deny the presence, and so far they are heretics.</p>

<p>3rd example. Indulgences.</p>

<p>Therefore the shortest way to hinder heresies is to teach all
truths, and the surest means of refuting them is to declare them
all. For what will the heretics say?</p>

<p>If the ancient Church was in error, the Church is fallen; if she
is so now it is not the same thing, for she has always the superior
maxim of tradition from the hand of the ancient Church; and thus
this submission and conformity to the ancient Church prevails
and corrects all. But the ancient Church did not postulate the
future Church, and did not regard her, as we postulate and
regard the ancient.</p>

<br />

<p>All err the more dangerously because they follow each a truth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
their fault is not that they follow an error, but that they do not
follow another truth.</p>

<br />

<p>That which hinders us in comparing what formerly took
place in the Church with what we now see, is that we are
wont to regard Saint Athanasius or Saint Theresa and others as
crowned with glory, and acting in regard to us as gods. Now
that time has cleared our vision we see that they are so. But when
this great saint was persecuted he was a man called Athanasius,
and Saint Theresa was a nun. "Elias was a man like ourselves
and subject to the same passions as ourselves," says Saint Peter, to
disabuse Christians of that false notion that we must reject the
examples of the saints as disproportioned to our state. They were
saints, say we, they are not like us. What was the case then?
Saint Athanasius was a man called Athanasius, accused of many
crimes, condemned by such and such a council for such and such
a crime. All the bishops assented to it, and at last the pope.
What did they say to those who resisted his condemnation?
That they were disturbing the peace, that they were creating a
schism, etc.</p>

<p>Four lands of persons: zeal without knowledge, knowledge
without zeal, neither knowledge nor zeal, zeal and knowledge.
The first three condemned him, the last absolved him, were
excommunicated by the Church and yet saved the Church.</p>

<br />

<p>The three notes of Religion: perpetuity, a good life, miracles.</p>

<p>They destroy perpetuity by probability, good life by their
morality, miracles in destroying either their truth or their consequence.</p>

<p>If we believe them, the Church has nothing to do with perpetuity,
a holy life, or miracles.</p>

<p>Heretics deny them or deny the consequences; they do the
same. But those must be devoid of sincerity who deny them
or again have lost their senses if they deny the consequences.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Perpetuity.</em>&mdash;Is your character founded on Escobar?</p>

<p>Perhaps you have reasons for not condemning them; it is
enough that you approve of those I address to you on the subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>Would the pope be dishonoured by gaining his light from God
and tradition; and does it not dishonour him to separate him
from this sacred union and....</p>

<p>Tertullian: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nunquam Ecclesia reformabitur.</i></p>

<p>Perpetuity.</p>

<p>Molina.</p>

<p>Novelty.</p>

<p>Heretics have always assailed these three notes which they
have not.</p>

<br />

<p>Those wretches, who have obliged me to speak on the foundations
of Religion.</p>

<p>Sinners purified without penitence, just men sanctified without
charity, all Christians without the grace of Jesus Christ, God
without power over the will of men, a predestination without
mystery, a redemption without certainty.</p>

<br />

<p>Sinners without penitence, just men without charity, a God
without power over the wills of men, a predestination without
mystery.</p>

<br />

<p>Those who love the Church complain that they see morals
corrupted, but laws at least exist. But these corrupt the laws.
The model is spoiled.</p>

<br />

<p>There is a contradiction; for on the one side they say tradition
must be followed, and would not dare disavow it, and on the
other they will say whatever pleases them. The former will
always be believed in, and indeed it would be going against
them not to believe it.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Politics.</em>&mdash;We have found two obstacles to the design of comforting
men. The one the interior laws of the Gospel, the
other the exterior laws of the State and of Religion.</p>

<p>We are masters of the one set of laws, the others we have dealt
with in this wise: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Amplienda, restringenda, a majori ad minus.</i></p>

<p><em>Junior.</em></p>

<br />

<p><em>Generals.</em>&mdash;It is not enough for them to introduce such morals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
into our churches, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">templis inducere mores</i>. Not only do they wish
to be tolerated in the Church, but as though they had become
the stronger, they would expel those who are not of them....</p>

<p>Mohatra. He who is astonished at this is no theologian.</p>

<p>Who would have told your generals that the time was so near
when they would give laws to the Church universal, and
would call the refusal of such disorders war, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tot et tanta mala
pacem</i>.</p>

<br />

<p>They cannot have perpetuity, and they seek universality;
therefore they make the whole Church corrupt, that they may be
saints.</p>

<br />

<p>You abuse the credence which the people has in the Church,
and make them believe untruth.</p>

<br />

<p>I suppose that men believe the miracles:</p>

<p>You corrupt Religion either in favour of your friends, or
against your enemies. You dispose of all at your will.</p>

<br />

<p>So that if it be true on the one hand that some lax religious,
and some corrupt casuists, who are not members of the hierarchy,
are steeped in these corruptions, it is on the other hand certain
that the true pastors of the Church, who are the true depositories
of the divine word, have preserved it unchangeably against the
efforts of those who have striven to ruin it.</p>

<p>And thus the faithful have no pretext to follow that laxity
which is only offered them by the stranger hands of these
casuists, instead of the sound doctrine which is presented to
them by the fatherly hands of their own pastors. And the
wicked and heretics have no reason to put forward these
abuses as marks of the defective providence of God over his
Church, since the Church having her true existence in the body
of the hierarchy, it is so far from the present condition of
things being a proof that God has abandoned her to corruption,
that it has never so plainly appeared as at the present day that
God visibly defends her from corruption.</p>

<p>For if some of these men, who by an extraordinary vocation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
have made profession of retirement from the world, and have
adopted the religious dress, that they might live in a more perfect
state than ordinary Christians, have fallen into disorders
which horrify ordinary Christians, and have become among us
what the false prophets were among the Jews; this is a private
and personal matter, which we must indeed deplore, but from
which we can conclude nothing against the care which God takes
for his Church; since all these things are so clearly foretold, and
it has been long since announced that temptations would arise
on account of such persons, so that when we are well instructed
we see therein rather the notes of the guidance of God than
his forgetfulness in regard to us.</p>

<br />

<p>You are ignorant of the prophecies if you do not know that
all this must needs happen, princes, prophets, pope, and even
the priests. And yet the Church must abide. By the grace
of God we are not so far gone. Woe to these priests. But we
hope that God will of his mercy grant us that we be not among
them.</p>

<p>2 Saint Peter ii. False prophets in the past the image of the
future.</p>

<br />

<p>Is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Est and non est</i> received in faith as well as in miracles, and
is it inseparable in the others?...</p>

<p>When Saint Xavier works miracles....</p>

<p>Saint Hilary.&mdash;These wretches who have obliged us to speak
of miracles.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Væ qui conditis leges iniquas.</i></p>

<p>Unjust judges, make not your laws on the moment, judge by
those which are established, and by yourselves.</p>

<p>To weaken your adversaries you disarm the whole Church.</p>

<p>If they say that our safety depends on God, they are heretics.</p>

<p>If they say they are under obedience to the pope, that is
hypocrisy.</p>

<p>If they are ready to assent to all the articles, that is not
enough.</p>

<p>If they say that no man should be killed for an apple, they
assail the morality of Catholics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>If miracles are wrought among them, it is no mark of holiness,
but rather a suspicion of heresy.</p>

<br />

<p>The hardness of the Jesuits therefore surpasses that of the Jews,
since those refused to believe Jesus Christ innocent only because
they doubted if his miracles were of God. But on the contrary,
though the Jesuits cannot doubt that the Port Royal miracles
were of God, they still continue to doubt the innocency of that
house.</p>

<br />

<p>Men never commit evil so fully and so gaily as when they do
so for conscience sake.</p>

<br />

<p>Experience shows us a vast difference between devoutness
and goodness.</p>

<br />

<p>The two contrary reasons. We must begin with that; without
that we understand nothing and all is heretical; in the same
way we must even add at the close of each truth that the opposite
truth is to be remembered.</p>

<br />

<p>If there was ever a time in which it were necessary to make
profession of two contraries, it is when we are reproached for
omitting one. Therefore the Jesuits and the Jansenists are wrong
in concealing them, but the Jansenists most, for the Jesuits have
better made profession of the two.</p>

<p>M. de Condran. There is, he says, no comparison between the
union of the saints and that of the Holy Trinity. Jesus Christ
says the opposite.</p>

<br />

<p>That we have treated them as kindly as is possible while
keeping ourselves in the mean, between the love of truth and the
duty of charity.</p>

<p>That piety does not consist in never opposing our brethren,
it would be very easy, etc.</p>

<p>It is false piety to keep peace to the prejudice of the truth.
It is also false zeal to keep truth and wound charity.</p>

<p>Neither have they complained.</p>

<p>Their maxims have their time and place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>He will be condemned indeed who is so by Escobar.</p>

<p>Their vanity tends to grow out of their errors.</p>

<p>Conformed to the fathers by their faults, and to the martyrs
by their sufferings.</p>

<p>Moreover they do not disavow any of....</p>

<p>They had only to take the passage, and disavow it.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sanctificavi prælium.</i></p>

<p>M. Bourseys. At least they cannot disavow that they are
opposed to the condemnation.</p>

<br />

<p>I have re-read them since, for I had not known them....</p>

<br />

<p>The world must be blind indeed if it believe you.</p>

<br />

<p>If men knew themselves, God would heal and pardon. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ne
convertantur, et sanem eos, et dimittantur eis peccata.</i> Isaiah.
Matt. xiii.</p>

<br />

<p>Truth is so obscure in these days, and falsehood so established,
that unless we love the truth we shall be unable to know it.</p>

<br />

<p>As Jesus Christ remained unknown among men, so his truth
remains among ordinary opinions without external difference.
Thus the Eucharist among ordinary bread. All faith consists
in Jesus Christ and in Adam, and all morals in lust and in grace.</p>

<br />

<p>"I have reserved me seven thousand." I love the worshippers
unknown to the world and even to the prophets.</p>

<br />

<p>To trust in forms is superstition, but to refuse to submit to
forms is pride.</p>

<br />

<p>As peace in States has for its sole object the safe preservation
of the property of the people, so the peace of the Church has for
its sole object the safe preservation of truth, her property and
the treasure where her heart is. And as to allow the enemy to
enter into a State, and pillage without opposition, for fear of
troubling repose, would be to work against the good of peace, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
peace, being only just and useful for the security of property,
it becomes unjust and harmful when it suffers property to be destroyed,
while war in the defence of property becomes just and
necessary. So in the Church, when truth is assailed by the
enemies of faith, when men would tear it from the heart of the
faithful, and cause error to reign there, to remain in peace is
rather to betray than to serve the Church, to ruin rather than
defend. And as it is plainly a crime to trouble peace where
truth reigns, so is it also a crime to rest in peace when truth is
destroyed. There is then a time when peace is just, and another
when it is unjust. And it is written that there is a time for peace
and a time for war, and it is the interest of truth to discern them.
But there is not a time for truth and a time for error, and it is
written, on the contrary, that the truth of God abideth for ever;
and this is why Jesus Christ, who said that he came to bring
peace, said also that he came to bring war. But he did not
say that he came to bring both truth and falsehood. Truth is
then the first rule and the ultimate end of things.</p>

<br />

<p>As the two principal interests of the Church are the preservation
of the piety of the faithful and the conversion of heretics, we are
overwhelmed with grief at the sight of factions now arising, to
introduce those errors which more than any others may close
for ever against heretics the entrance into our communion,
and fatally corrupt those pious and catholic persons who remain
to us. This enterprise, made at the present day so openly against
those truths of Religion most important for salvation, fills us
not only with displeasure, but also with fear and even terror,
because, besides the feeling which every Christian must have
of these disorders, we have further an obligation to remedy
them, and to employ the authority which God has given, to
cause that the peoples which he has committed to us, etc.</p>

<br />

<p>We must let heretics know, who gain advantage from the doctrine
of the Jesuits, that it is not that of the Church ... the
doctrine of the Church, and that our divisions separate us not
from the altar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>They hide themselves in the crowd, and call numbers to
their aid.</p>

<p>Tumult.</p>

<br />

<p>In corrupting the bishops and the Sorbonne, if they have not
had the advantage of making their judgment just, they have had
that of making their judges unjust. And thus, when in future
they are condemned, they will say <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad hominem</i> that they are
unjust, and thus will refute their judgment. But that does no
good. For as they cannot conclude that the Jansenists are
rightly condemned because they are condemned, so they cannot
conclude then that they themselves will be wrongly condemned
because they will be so by corruptible judges. For their
condemnation will be just, not because it will be given by judges
always just, but by judges just in that particular, which will be
shown by other proofs.</p>

<br />

<p>These are the effects of the sins of the peoples and of the
Jesuits, great men have wished to be flattered, the Jesuits have
wished to be loved by the great. They have all been worthy
to be given up to the spirit of lying, the one party to deceive,
the others to be deceived. They have been greedy, ambitious,
pleasure loving: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Coacervabunt tibi magistros</i>.</p>

<br />

<p><em>The Jesuits.</em></p>

<p>The Jesuits have wished to unite God and the world, and have
gained only the scorn of God and the world. For, on the side
of conscience this is plain, and on the side of the world they are
not good partisans. They have power, as I have often said, but
that is in regard to other religious. They will have interest
enough to get a chapel built, and to have a jubilee station, not
to make appointments to bishoprics and government offices.
The position of a monk in the world is a most foolish one,
and that they hold by their own declaration.&mdash;Father Brisacier,
the Benedictines.&mdash;Yet ... you yield to those more powerful
than yourselves, and oppress with all your little credit those
who have less power for intrigue in the world than you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<br />

<p><em>Venice.</em>&mdash;What advantage will you draw from it, except the
princes' need of it, and the horror the nations have had of it.
If these had asked you and, in order to obtain it, had implored
the assistance of all Christian princes, you might have boasted
of this importunity. But not that during fifty years all the
princes have exerted themselves for it in vain, and that it
required such a pressing need to obtain it</p>

<br />

<p>If by differing we condemned, you would be right. Uniformity
without diversity is useless to others, diversity without uniformity
is ruinous for us. The one injures us without; the other within.</p>

<br />

<p>We ought to hear both parties, and on this point I have been
careful.</p>

<p>When we have heard only one party we are always on that
side, but the adverse party makes us change, whereas in this
case the Jesuit confirms us.</p>

<p>Not what they do, but what they say.</p>

<p>They cry out against me only. I am content I know whom
to blame for it.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ was a stone of stumbling.</p>

<p>Condemnable, condemned.</p>

<br />

<p>Jesus Christ never condemned without a bearing. To Judas:
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Amice, ad quid venisti</i>? To him who had not on the wedding
garment, the same.</p>

<br />

<p>Unless they give up probability their good maxims are as little
holy as the bad. For they are founded on human authority,
and thus if they are more just they will be more reasonable, but
not more holy, they take after the wild stock on which they are
graffed.</p>

<p>If what I say serves not to enlighten you, it will aid the people.&mdash;If
these hold their peace, the stones will cry out.</p>

<p>Silence is the greatest persecution; the saints never held their
peace. It is true that a vocation is needed, it is not from the
decrees of the Council that we must learn whether we are called,
but from the compulsion to speak. Now after Rome has spoken,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
and we think that she has condemned the truth, and they have
written it, and the books which have said the contrary are
censured; we must cry so much the louder the more unjustly
we are censured, and the more violently they try to stifle
speech, until there come a pope who listens to both sides, and
who consults antiquity to do justice.</p>

<p>So good popes will find the Church still in an uproar.</p>

<p>The Inquisition and the Society are the two scourges of the
truth.</p>

<p>Why do you not accuse them of Arianism? For if they have
said that Jesus Christ is God, perhaps it is not with a natural
meaning, but as it is said: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dii estis</i>.</p>

<p>If my Letters are condemned at Rome, what I condemn in
them is condemned in heaven.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ad tuum, Domine Jesu, tribunal appello.</i></p>

<p>You are yourselves corruptible.</p>

<p>I feared that I had written ill when I saw myself condemned,
but the example of so many pious writings makes me believe the
contrary. Good writing is no longer permitted, so corrupt or
ignorant is the Inquisition.</p>

<p>It is better to obey God than men.</p>

<p>I have neither fear nor hope. Not so the bishops. Port Royal
fears, and it is a bad policy to dissolve the community, for they
will fear no longer and will inspire greater fear.</p>

<p>I fear not even your censures, ... if they be not founded on
those of tradition.</p>

<p>Do you censure all? What, even my respect?&mdash;No.&mdash;Say
then, what it is, or you will do nothing, since you do not point out
the evil, and why it is evil. And this is what they will have
some trouble to do.</p>

<br />

<p>Unjust persecutors of those whom God visibly protects.</p>

<p>If they reproach you with your excesses they speak as do the
heretics.</p>

<p>If they say that the grace of Jesus Christ separates us, they are
heretics.</p>

<p>If miracles are wrought, it is the mark of their heresy.</p>

<p>Ezekiel,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>They say, these are the people of God who thus speak.</p>

<p>Hezekiah,</p>

<p>My reverend father, all this was done in figures. Other religions
perish, this one perishes not.</p>

<p>Miracles are more important than you think, they have served
for the foundation, and will serve for the continuance of the
Church till the coming of Antichrist, till the end.</p>

<p>The two witnesses.</p>

<p>In the Old Testament and the New, miracles are wrought
in connection with types. Salvation or an useless thing, if not
to show that we must submit to the creature.&mdash;Figure of the
sacraments.</p>

<p>The synagogue was a figure and so it perished not, and it was
only the figure and so it has perished. It was a figure which
contained the truth, and so it subsisted till it contained the truth
no longer.</p>

<br />

<p>The exaggerated notion which you have of the importance of
your society has made you establish these horrible ways. It is
very plain that it has made you follow the way of slander, since
you blame in me as horrible the same impostures which you
excuse in yourselves, because you regard me as a private person,
and yourselves as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">imago</i>.</p>

<p>It plainly appears that your praises are follies, by those which
are crazy, as the privilege of the uncondemned.</p>

<p>Is this giving courage to your children to condemn them when
they serve the Church?</p>

<p>It is an artifice of the devil to turn in another direction the
arms with which these people used to combat heresies.</p>

<p>You are bad politicians.</p>

<p>The history of the man born blind.</p>

<p>What says Saint Paul? Does he constantly speak of the
bearing of prophecies? No, but of his miracles.</p>

<p>What says Jesus Christ? Does he expound the bearing of
the prophecies? No, his death had not fulfilled them; but he
says, si non fecissem: believe the works.</p>

<p>These wretches who have obliged us to speak of miracles!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>Abraham and Gideon confirmed faith by miracles.</p>

<p>There are two supernatural foundations of our wholly supernatural
Religion, the one visible, the other invisible.</p>

<p>Miracles with grace, miracles without grace.</p>

<p>The synagogue, which has been treated with love as a figure of
the Church, and with hatred because it was only the figure, has
been restored, being about to fall when it was well with God, and
thus a figure.</p>

<p>The miracles prove the power which God has over hearts by
that which he exercises over the body.</p>

<p>The Church has never approved a miracle among heretics.</p>

<p>Miracles are a support of religion. They have been the
test of Jews, of Christians, of saints, of innocents, and of true
believers.</p>

<br />

<p>A miracle among schismatics is not much to be feared, for
schism which is more evident than miracle, evidently marks their
error; but when there is no schism, and error is in question,
miracle is the test.</p>

<p>Judith. God speaks at length in their extreme oppression.</p>

<p>If because charity has grown cold the Church is left almost
without true worshippers, miracles will raise them up.</p>

<p>This is one of the last effects of grace.</p>

<p>If only a miracle were wrought among the Jesuits!</p>

<p>When a miracle deceives the expectation of those in whose
presence it occurs, and when there is a disproportion between
the state of their faith and the instrument of the miracle it must
lead them to change; but with you it is the opposite. There
would be as much reason in saying that if the Eucharist raised
a dead man one ought to turn Calvinist rather than remain
a Catholic. But when he crowns the expectation, and those who
have hoped that God would bless the remedies see themselves
cured without remedies....</p>

<p><em>The wicked.</em>&mdash;No sign was ever given on the part of the devil
without a stronger sign on the part of God, at least unless it
were foretold that this would be so.</p>

<br />

<p>These nuns, amazed at what is said, that they are in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
way of perdition, that their confessors are leading them to
Geneva, and teach them Jesus Christ is not in the Eucharist,
nor on the right hand of the Father, know all this to be
false, and offer then themselves to God in that state. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vide
si via iniquitatis in me est.</i> What happens thereupon?
The place, which is said to be the temple of the devil, God
makes his own temple. It is said that the children must
be taken away, God heals them there. It is said to be hell's
arsenal, God makes of it the sanctuary of his graces. Lastly,
they are threatened with all the furies and all the vengeance of
heaven, and God loads them with favours. Those must
have lost their senses, who therefore believe them in the
way of perdition.&mdash;<em>We have, without doubt, the same tokens as
Saint Athanasius.</em>&mdash;</p>

<p>The five propositions were equivocal; they are so no
longer.</p>

<br />

<p>With so many other signs of piety they have that of persecution
also, which is the best mark of piety.</p>

<br />

<p>By showing the truth we gain belief for it, but by showing
the injustice of ministers, we do not correct it. Conscience is
made secure by a demonstration of falsehood; our purse is not
made secure by the demonstration of injustice.</p>

<p>Miracles and truth are both needful, as we have to convince
the whole man, body and soul alike.</p>

<br />

<p>It is good that their deeds should be unjust, for fear it should
not appear that the Molinists have acted justly. Thus there
is no need to spare them, they are worthy to commit them.</p>

<br />

<p><em>The Church, the Pope.</em>&mdash;Unity, plurality. Considering the
Church as unity, the pope its head, is as the whole; considered
as plurality, the pope is only a part of it. The Fathers have
considered the Church now in this way, now in that, and thus
they have spoken in divers ways of the pope.</p>

<p>Saint Cyprian, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sacerdos Dei</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>But in establishing one of these two truths, they have not excluded
the other.</p>

<p>Plurality which cannot be reduced to unity is confusion. Unity
which depends not on plurality is tyranny.</p>

<p>There is scarce any where left but France in which it is
allowable to say that a council is below the pope.</p>

<p>We may not judge of what the pope is by some words of the
Fathers&mdash;as the Greeks said in a council, important rules&mdash;but
by the acts of the Church and the Fathers, and by the canons.</p>

<p>Unity and plurality: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Duo aut tres in unum</i>. It is an error
to exclude one of the two, as the papists do who exclude plurality,
or the Huguenots who exclude unity.</p>

<br />

<p>The pope is chief, who else is known of all, who else is
recognised by all? Having power to insinuate himself into all
the body, because he holds the leading shoot, which extends
itself everywhere.</p>

<p>How easy to cause this to degenerate into tyranny. This is
why Jesus Christ has laid down for them this precept: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vos
autem non sic</i>.</p>

<br />

<p>God works not miracles in the ordinary conduct of his Church.
It would be a strange miracle, did infallibility reside in one, but
that it should dwell in a multitude appears so natural that the
ways of God are concealed under nature, as all his other works.</p>

<br />

<p>Men desire certainty, they like the pope to be infallible in
faith, grave doctors to be infallible in morals, in order to have
certainty.</p>

<br />

<p>The pope hates and fears men of science, who are not at once
submissive to him.</p>

<br />

<p>Kings are masters of their own power, not so the popes.</p>

<br />

<p>Whenever the Jesuits take the pope unawares, they will make
all Christendom perjured.</p>

<p>It is very easy to take the pope unawares, because of his
occupations, and the trust which he has in the Jesuits, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
the Jesuits are very capable of taking him unawares by means
of calumny.</p>

<br />

<p>The five propositions condemned, yet no miracle, for truth was
not attacked, but the Sorbonne and the bull.</p>

<p>It is impossible that those who love God with all their heart,
should misunderstand the Church, which is so evident.</p>

<p>It is impossible that those who love not God should be convinced
of the Church.</p>

<br />

<p>Let us look to the discourses on the 2nd, 4th, and 5th of the
Jansenist. They are lofty and grave.</p>

<p>We would not make a friend of either.</p>

<p>The ear only is consulted because the heart is wanting.</p>

<p>Beauty of omission, of judgment.</p>

<p>The rule is that of honourable conduct.</p>

<p>Poet and not honourable man.</p>

<br />

<p>These men want heart.</p>

<p>We would not make a friend of him.</p>

<p>For this name of honourable man.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Canonical.</em>&mdash;The heretical books in the early age of the Church
serve to prove the canonical.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Heretics.</em>&mdash;Ezekiel. All the heathens spake evil of Israel, and
the Prophet did the same, yet the Israelites were so far from
having a right to say to him, "You speak as the heathen,"
that he made it his strongest point that the heathens said the
same as he.</p>

<br />

<p>Those are feeble souls who know the truth, and uphold it only
so far as their interest is concerned, but beyond that abandon it.</p>

<br />

<p>Annat. He makes the disciple without ignorance, and the
master without presumption.</p>

<br />

<p>There is such great disproportion between the merit which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
thinks he has and his stupidity, that it is hard to believe he
mistakes himself so completely.</p>

<br />

<p>And will this one scorn the other?</p>

<p>Who should scorn? Yet he scorns not the other, but pities
him.</p>

<br />

<p>Port Royal is surely as good as Voltigerod.</p>

<p>So far as your proceeding is just according to this bias, so
far is it unjust on the side of Christian piety.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Montalte.</em>&mdash;Lax opinions are so pleasing to men, that it is
strange that theirs displease. It is because they have exceeded
all bounds; and more, there are many persons who see the
truth, yet cannot attain to it; but there are few who do not know
that the purity of religion is contrary to our corruptions. It is
absurd to say that eternal reward is offered to the morals of
Escobar.</p>

<br />

<p>But is it <em>probable</em> that <em>probability</em> gives certainty?&mdash;Difference
between rest and security of conscience. Nothing but truth gives
certainty. Nothing gives rest but a sincere search after truth.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Probability.</em> They have oddly explained certainty, for after
having established that all their ways are sure, they no longer
call that sure which leads to heaven without danger of not
arriving thereby, but that which leads there without danger of
going out of the road.</p>

<br />

<p>Now probability is necessary for the other maxims, as for that
of the friend and the slanderer.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">A fructibus eorum</i>, judge of their faith by their morals.</p>

<p>Probability is little without corrupt means, and means are
nothing without probability.</p>

<p>There is pleasure in being able to do good, and in knowing
how to do good, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scire et posse</i>. Grace and probability give this
pleasure, for we can render our account to God in reliance
upon their authors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<br />

<p><em>Probability.</em></p>

<p>Everyone can impose it, none can take it away.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Probable.</em>&mdash;If as bad reasons as these are probable, all would
be so.</p>

<p>1. Reason. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dominus actuum conjugalium.</i> Molina.</p>

<p>2. Reason. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non potest compensari.</i> Lessius.</p>

<p>To oppose not with holy, but with abominable maxims.</p>

<p>They reason as those who prove that it is night at midday.</p>

<p>Bauny, the burner of barns.</p>

<p>... The Council of Trent for priests in mortal sin: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quam
primum</i>....</p>

<br />

<p><em>Probable.</em>&mdash;Let us see if we seek God sincerely, by the comparison
of things we love.</p>

<p>It is probable that this meat will not poison me.</p>

<p>It is probable that I shall not lose my law suit if I do not
bring it.</p>

<p>If it were true that grave authors and reasons would suffice, I
say that they are neither grave nor reasonable. What! a husband
may make profit of his wife according to Molina. Is
the reason he gives reasonable, and the contrary one of Lessius
reasonable also?</p>

<p>Would you dare thus to trifle with the edicts of the King, as
by saying that to go for a walk in a field and wait for a man is
not to fight a duel;</p>

<p>That the Church has indeed forbidden duelling, but not
taking a walk?</p>

<p>And usury too, but not....</p>

<p>And simony, but not....</p>

<p>And vengeance, but not....</p>

<p>And unnatural crime, but not....</p>

<p>And <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quam primum</i>, but not....</p>

<br />

<p>Take away <em>probability</em>, and you can no longer please the
world, give <em>probability</em>, and you can no longer displease it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<br />

<p><em>Universal.</em>&mdash;Morals and language are special but universal
sciences.</p>

<p><em>Probability.</em>&mdash;The zeal of the saints to seek the truth, was
useless if the probable is certain.</p>

<p>The fear of the saints who have always followed the surest way.</p>

<p>Saint Theresa having always followed her confessor.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Probability.</em>&mdash;They have some true principles, but they abuse
them. Now the abuse of truth should be as much punished as
the introduction of falsehood.</p>

<p>As if there were two hells, one for sins against charity, the
other for sins against justice.</p>

<br />

<p>Men who do not keep their word, without faith, without honour,
without truth, double hearted, double tongued, like the reproach
once flung at that amphibious creature in the fable, who kept
itself in a doubtful position between the fish and the birds.</p>

<p>It is of importance to kings and princes to be supposed
pious, and therefore they must take you for their confessors.</p>

<br />

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">State super vias et interrogate de semitis antiquis, et ambulate
in eis. Et dixerunt: Non ambulabimus, sed post cogitationem
nostram ibimus.</i> They have said to the nations: Come to us,
we will follow the opinions of the new authors, reason shall be
our guide, we will be as the other nations who follow each their
natural light. Philosophers have....</p>

<p>All religions and sects in the world have had natural reason
for a guide. Christians alone have been obliged to take their rules
from without themselves, and to acquaint themselves with those
which Jesus Christ left to men of old time to be transmitted to the
faithful. This constraint is wearisome to these good fathers.
They desire like the rest of the world to have liberty to follow
their imaginations. In vain we cry to them, as the prophets to
the Jews of old: "Enter into the Church, enquire of the ways
which men of old have left to her, and follow those paths." They
have answered, as did the Jews, "We will not walk in them, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
we will follow the thoughts of our hearts;" and they have said,
"We will be as the nations round about us."</p>

<br />

<p>Can it be any thing but the desire to please the world which
makes you find things probable? Will you make us believe
that it is truth, and that if duelling were not the fashion, you
would find it probable they might fight, looking at the matter in
itself?</p>

<br />

<p>The whole society of their casuists cannot give assurance to a
conscience in error, and therefore it is important to choose
safe guides.</p>

<p>Thus they will be doubly guilty, both in having followed ways
which they should not follow, and in having hearkened to
teachers to whom they should not hearken.</p>

<br />

<p>Casuists submit the decision to corrupt reason, and the choice
of decisions to corrupt will, so that all that is corrupt in the
nature of man may help to rule his conduct.</p>

<br />

<p>They allow lust free play, and restrict scruples, whereas they
should do the exact contrary.</p>

<br />

<p>Must we slay in order that the wicked may cease to be?
This is to make two wicked instead of one. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vince in bono
malum.</i> Saint Augustine.</p>

<br />

<p>The servant does not know what the master does, for the
master tells him only the act and not the purpose; this is why
he is so often slavishly obedient and often sins against the
purpose. But Jesus Christ tells us the purpose.</p>

<p>And you destroy this purpose.</p>

<br />

<p>Art thou less a slave because thy master loves and caresses
thee? Thou art indeed well off, slave. Thy master caresses
thee, he will presently beat thee.</p>

<br />

<p>Those who wrote thus in Latin speak in French.</p>

<p>The evil having been done of patting these things in French,
we ought to do the good of condemning them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>There is one only heresy, which is differently explained in the
schools and in the world.</p>

<br />

<p><em>On confessions and absolutions without signs of regret.</em> God
looks at the heart alone, the Church looks at outward actions;
God absolves as soon as he sees penitence in the heart, the Church
when she sees it in works. God will make a Church pure
within, which puts to confusion by its interior and perfect spiritual
holiness the interior impiety of proud philosophers and Pharisees,
and the Church will make an assembly of men whose external
morals are so pure that they put to confusion heathen morals.
If some are hypocrites, but so well disguised that she does not
recognise their venom, she bears with them, for though they are
not accepted of God, whom they cannot deceive, they are of men,
whom they deceive. And thus she is not dishonoured by their
conduct which appears holy. But you will have it that the
Church should judge neither of the heart, for that belongs to
God alone, nor of works, because God looks at the heart alone;
and so taking away from her all choice of men, you retain
in the Church the most debauched and those who so greatly dishonour
her, that the synagogues of the Jews and the sects of
the philosophers would have cast them out as unworthy, and
have abhorred them as impious.</p>

<br />

<p>God has not willed to absolve without the Church. As she
has part in the offence he wills that she should have part in the
pardon. He associates her with this power as kings their
parliaments; but if she binds or looses without God, she is
no more the Church, as in the case of parliament. For even
if the king have pardoned a man, it is necessary that it should
be ratified; but if the parliament ratifies without the king, or
refuses to ratify on the order of the king, it is no more the
parliament of the king, but a revolutionary body.</p>

<br />

<p>The Church teaches and God inspires, both infallibly. The
operation of the Church serves only to prepare for grace or
for condemnation. What it does suffices for condemnation,
not for inspiration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>The Church has in vain established these words, anathema,
heresies. They are used against herself.</p>

<br />

<p>It is not absolution only which remits sins by the Sacrament
of Penance, but contrition, which is not a true contrition if it
does not frequent the sacrament.</p>

<p>Thus, again, it is not the nuptial benediction which hinders
sin in generation, but the desire of begetting children for God,
which is no true desire except in marriage.</p>

<p>And as a contrite man without the sacrament is more disposed
for absolution than an impenitent man with the sacrament, so
the daughters of Lot, for instance, who had only the desire for
children, were more pure without marriage than married persons
without desire for children.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Casuists.</em>&mdash;Much almsgiving, reasonable penance; even
when we cannot assign what is just, we see plainly what is
not. It is strange that casuists believe they can interpret this as
they do.</p>

<p>People who accustom themselves to speak ill and to think ill.</p>

<p>Their great number, far from marking their perfection, marks
the contrary.</p>

<p>The humility of one makes the pride of many.</p>

<br />

<p>They make a rule of the exception. If the ancient fathers gave
absolution before penance; do this only as an exception.
But of the exception you make a rule without exception, so that
you will not even have it that the rule is exceptional.</p>

<br />

<p>Priest still who will, as under Jeroboam.</p>

<p>It is a horrible thing that they submit to us the discipline of the
Church in our days as so excellent that it is made a crime to wish
to change it Formerly it was infallibly good, and it was found
it might be changed without sin, and now, such as it is, we ought
not to wish it changed!</p>

<p>It has indeed been allowed to change the custom of not making
priests save with such great circumspection, that there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
scarcely any who were worthy, yet we are not allowed to complain
of the custom which makes so many who are unworthy.</p>

<br />

<p>Two sorts of people place things on the same level, as feasts
and working days, Christians and priests, all sins among themselves,
etc. Therefore the one set conclude that what is bad
for priests is so for Christians, and the other that what is not
bad for Christians is permissible for priests.</p>

<br />

<p>The Jansenists are like the heretics in the reformation of their
morals, but you are like them in evil.</p>

<br />

<p>Superstition to believe propositions, etc.</p>

<p>Faith, etc.</p>

<br />

<p>If Saint Augustine came at this day, and was as little authorised
as his defenders, he would do nothing. God governs his Church
well, in that he sent him before with authority.</p>

<br />

<p>Grace is needed to make a man into a saint, and if any
man doubt this he knows not what is a saint, nor what is a
man.</p>

<br />

<p>The motions of grace, hardness of heart, external circumstances.</p>

<br />

<p>Grace will ever be in the world, and nature also, so that grace
is in some sort natural. Thus there will be always Pelagians,
always Catholics, always strife.</p>

<p>Because the first birth constitutes the one, and the grace of
regeneration the other.</p>

<br />

<p>It will be one of the confusions of the damned to see themselves
condemned by their own reason, by which they have thought to
condemn the Christian religion.</p>

<br />

<p>When it is said that Jesus Christ died not for all, you take
advantage of a defect inherent in men who immediately apply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
this exception to themselves, which is to favour despair instead
of turning men from it to favour hope. For so we accustom
ourselves to interior virtues by exterior customs.</p>

<br />

<p>There is heresy in always explaining omnes by 'all,' and
heresy in not explaining it sometimes by 'all.' <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bibite ex hoc
omnes</i>, the Huguenots are heretics in explaining it by 'all.'
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">In quo omnes peccaverunt</i>, the Huguenots are heretics in excepting
the children of the faithful. We must then follow the
Fathers and tradition to know when to do so, since there is heresy
to be feared on one side or the other.</p>

<br />

<p><em>A point of form.</em>&mdash;When Saint Peter and the apostles consulted
about the abolition of circumcision, when it was a question of
acting in contradiction to the law of God, they did not consult
the prophets, but considered simply the reception of the Holy
Spirit in the persons uncircumcised. They judged it more
certain that God approved those whom he filled with his spirit,
than it was that the law must be observed.</p>

<p>They knew that the end of the Law was none other than the
Holy Spirit, and thus as men certainly had this without circumcision,
circumcision was not needful.</p>

<br />

<p>But to preserve pre-eminence to himself he gives prayer to
whom he pleases.</p>

<p>Why God has established prayer.</p>

<p>1. To communicate to his creatures the dignity of causality.</p>

<p>2. To teach us from whom our virtue comes.</p>

<p>3. To make us deserve other virtues by work.</p>

<p><em>Objection.</em> But we believe that prayer comes from ourselves.</p>

<p>This is absurd, for since before we have faith, we cannot have
virtues, how should we have faith? Is there a greater distance
between infidelity and faith than between faith and virtue?</p>

<p><em>Merit.</em> This word is ambiguous.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Meruit habere Redemptorem.</i></p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Meruit tam sacra membra tangere.</i></p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Digna tam sacra membra tangere.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non sum dignus, qui manducat indignus.</i></p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dignus est accipere.</i></p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dignare me.</i></p>

<p>God is only bound according to his promises.</p>

<p>He has promised to do justice to prayer, he has never promised
prayer only to the children of promise.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Si</em> does not mark indifference. Malachi, Isaiah.</p>

<p>Isaiah. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Si volumus</i>, etc.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">In quacumque die.</i></p>

<br />

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ne timeas, pusillus grex. Timore et tretmore.&mdash;Quid ergo? Ne
timeas, modo timeas.</i></p>

<p>Fear not, provided you fear, but if you fear not, then fear.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Qui me recipit, non me recipit, sed eum qui me misit.</i></p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nemo scit neque Filius.</i></p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nubes lucida obumbravit.</i></p>

<p>Saint John was to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,
and Jesus Christ was to sow division. In this there is no
contradiction.</p>

<br />

<p>The effects <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in communi</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in particulari</i>. The semi-Pelagians
err in saying of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in communi</i> what is true only <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in particulari</i>,
and the Calvinists in saying <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in particulari</i> what is true <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in
communi</i>. So it seems to me.</p>

<br />

<p>Saint Augustine has said expressly that power would be taken
away from the righteous. But it is by chance that he said it, for it
might have been that the chance of saying it did not occur.
But his principles make us see that when the occasion for it
presented itself, it was impossible he should not say so, or that he
should say anything to the contrary. It is then rather that he was
forced to say it, when the occasion offered itself, than that he
said it, the occasion having offered itself, the one being of necessity,
the other of chance. But the two are all that we could ask.</p>

<br />

<p><em>The end</em>. Are we certain? Is this principle certain? Let us
examine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<br />

<p>The testimony of a man's self is naught Saint Thomas.</p>

<br />

<p>The image alone of all these mysteries has been openly
showed to the Jews and by Saint John the forerunner, and then
the other mysteries, to mark that in each man as in the world at
large this order must be observed.</p>

<br />

<p>It is, in technical language, <em>wholly</em> the body of Jesus Christ,
but it cannot be said to be the <em>whole</em> body of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>The union of two things without change cannot enable us to
say that one becomes the other.</p>

<p>Thus the soul is united to the body, the fire to the fuel, without
change.</p>

<p>But change is necessary to make the form of the one become
the form of the other.</p>

<p>Thus the union of the Word to man.</p>

<p>Because my body without my soul would not make the body
of a man, then my soul united to any matter whatsoever would
make my body.</p>

<p>It distinguishes for me the necessary condition with a sufficient
condition, the union is necessary, but not sufficient.</p>

<p>The left arm is not the right.</p>

<p>Impenetrability is a property of matter.</p>

<p>Identity of number in regard to the same time requires the
identity of matter.</p>

<p>Thus if God united my soul to a body in China, the same body,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">idem numero</i> would be in China.</p>

<p>The same river which runs there is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">idem numero</i> as that
which runs at the same time in China.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>THOUGHTS ON STYLE.</em></a></h3>
</div>

    <div>

<p class="noindent">Eloquence is an art of saying things in such a manner, 1, that
those to whom we speak can hear them without pain, and
with pleasure; 2, that they feel themselves interested, so that
self-love leads them more willingly to reflect upon what is said.
It consists therefore in a correspondence which we endeavour to
establish between the mind and the heart of those to whom we
speak on the one hand, and, on the other, the thoughts and the
expressions employed; this supposes that we have thoroughly
studied the heart of man so as to know all its springs, and to find
at last the true proportions of the discourse we wish to suit to it.
We should put ourselves in the place of those who are to listen
to us, and make experiment on our own heart of the turn we
give to our discourse, to see whether one is made for the other,
and whether we can be sure that our auditor will be as it were
forced to yield. So far as possible we must confine ourselves
to what is natural and simple, not aggrandise that which is
little, or belittle that which is great. It is not enough that a
phrase be beautiful, it must be fitted to the subject, and not
have in it excess or defect.</p>

<br />

<p>Eloquence is painted thought, and thus those who, after
having painted it, add somewhat more, make a picture, not a
portrait.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Eloquence.</em>&mdash;We need both what is pleasing and what is real,
but that which pleases must itself be drawn from the true.</p>

<br />

<p>Eloquence, which persuades by gentleness, not by empire, as
a tyrant, not as a king.</p>

<br />

<p>There is a certain pattern of charm and beauty which consists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
in a certain relation between our nature, such as it is,
whether weak or strong, and the thing which pleases us.</p>

<p>Whatever is formed on this pattern delights us, whether
house, song, discourse, verse, prose, woman, birds, rivers, trees,
rooms, dresses, etc.</p>

<p>Whatever is not made on this pattern displeases those who
have good taste.</p>

<p>And as there is a perfect relation between a song and a house
which are made on a good pattern, because they are like this
unique pattern, though each after its kind, there is also a perfect
relation between things made on a bad pattern. Not that the
bad is unique, for there are many; but every bad sonnet, for
instance, on whatever false pattern it is constructed, is exactly
like a woman dressed on that pattern.</p>

<p>Nothing makes us understand better the absurdity of a false
sonnet than to consider nature and the pattern, and then to
imagine a woman or a house constructed on that pattern.</p>

<br />

<p>When a natural discourse paints a passion or an effect, we
feel in our mind the truth of what we read, which was there before,
though we did not know it, and we are inclined to love him
who makes us feel it. For he has not made a display of his
own riches, but of ours, and thus this benefit renders him
pleasant to us, besides that such a community of intellect
necessarily inclines the heart to love.</p>

<br />

<p>All the false beauties which we blame in Cicero have their
admirers and in great number.</p>

<br />

<p>The last thing we decide on in writing a book is what shall
be the first we put in it.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Language.</em>&mdash;We ought not to turn the mind from one thing to
another save for relaxation, at suitable times, and no other, for
he that diverts out of season wearies, and he who wearies us out
of season repels us, and we simply turn away. So much it pleases
our wayward lust to do the exact contrary of what those seek to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
obtain from us who give us no pleasure, the coin for which we
will do whatever we are asked.</p>

<br />

<p>When we meet with a natural style, we are charmed and astonished,
for we looked for an author, and we found a man. But
those who have good taste, and who seeing a book expect to
find a man, are altogether surprised to find an author: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">plus
poetice quam humane locatus es</i>. Those pay great honour to
nature, who show her that she is able to discourse on all things,
even on theology.</p>

<br />

<p>Languages are ciphers, where letters are not changed into
letters, but words into words, so that an unknown language can
be deciphered.</p>

<br />

<p>When in a discourse we find words repeated, and in trying to
correct them find we cannot change them for others without
manifest disadvantage, we must let them stand, for this is
the true test; our criticism came of envy which is blind, and
does not see that repetition is not in this place a fault, for there
is no general rule.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Miscellaneous.</em> <em>Language.</em>&mdash;Those who force words for the
sake of antitheses are like those who make false windows for
symmetry.</p>

<p>Their rule is not to speak accurately, but in accurate form.</p>

<br />

<p>To put a mask on nature and disguise her. No more King,
pope, bishop, but <em>sacred majesty</em>, no more Paris, but <em>the capital
of the Kingdom</em>.</p>

<p>There are places in which we should call Paris, Paris, and
others in which we ought to call it the capital of the Kingdom.</p>

<br />

<p>There are those who speak well and write ill. Because the
place and the audience warm them, and draw from their minds
more than would have been produced without that warmth.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Miscellaneous.</em>&mdash;A figure of speech, "I should have wished to
apply myself to that."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<br />

<p>The <em>aperitive</em> virtue of a key, the <em>attractive</em> virtue of a crook.</p>

<br />

<p>To guess. <em>The part that I take in your sorrow.</em> The
Cardinal did not choose to be guessed.</p>

<p><em>My mind is disquieted within me.</em> I am disquieted is better.</p>

<br />

<p><em>To extinguish the torch of sedition</em>, too luxuriant.</p>

<p><em>The restlessness of his genius.</em> Two striking words too much.</p>

<br />

<p>A coach <em>upset</em> or <em>overturned</em>, according to the meaning.</p>

<p><em>Spread abroad</em>, or <em>upset</em>, according to the meaning.</p>

<p>The argument by force of M. le M. over the friar.</p>

<br />

<p>Symmetry.</p>

<p>Is what we see at one glance.</p>

<p>Founded on the fact that there is no reason for any difference.</p>

<p>And founded also on the face of man.</p>

<p>Whence it comes that symmetry is only wanted in breadth,
not in height or depth.</p>

<br />

<p>Sceptic, for obstinate.</p>

<p>Descartes useless and uncertain.</p>

<p>No one calls another a courtier but he who is not one himself,
a pedant save a pedant, a provincial but a provincial, and I
would wager it was the printer who put it on the title of <cite>Letters
to a Provincial</cite>.</p>

<br />

<p>The chief talent, that which rules all others.</p>

<br />

<p>If the lightning were to strike low-lying places, etc., poets, and
those whose only reasonings are on things of that nature would
lack proofs.</p>

<br />

<p><em>Poetical beauty.</em>&mdash;As we talk of poetical beauty, so ought we to
talk of mathematical beauty and medical beauty; yet we do not
use those terms, because we know perfectly the object of mathematics,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
that it consists in proofs, and the object of medicine, that
it consists in healing, but we do not understand wherein consists
charm which is the object of poetry. We do not know what
is the natural model to be imitated, and for want of that knowledge
we invent a set of extravagant terms, "<em>the golden age</em>,
<em>the wonder of our times</em>, <em>fatal</em>," etc., and fall this jargon poetic
beauty.</p>

<p>But if we imagine a woman on that pattern, which consists in
saying little things in great words, we shall see a pretty girl bedecked
with mirrors and chains absurd to our taste, because we
know better wherein consists the charm of woman than the
charm of verse. But those who do not know, would admire her
in such trimmings, and in many villages she would be taken for
the queen, wherefore sonnets made on such a pattern have been
called <em>The Village Queens</em>.</p>

<br />

<p>Those who judge of a work without rule are in regard to others
as those who possess a watch are in regard to others. One
says, "it was two hours ago," another, "it is only three-quarters
of an hour." I look at my watch and say to the one, "you are
weary of us," and to the other, "time flies fast with you, for it
is only an hour and a half." And I laugh at those who say that
time goes slowly with me, and that I judge by fancy. They do
not know that I judge by my watch.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>VARIOUS THOUGHTS.</em></a></h3>
</div>

    <div>

<p class="noindent"><em>Mathematics, Tact.</em>&mdash;True eloquence makes light of eloquence,
true morality makes light of morality, that is to say, the
morality of the judgment makes light of the morality of the
intellect, which has no rules.</p>

<p>For perception belongs to judgment, as science belongs to the
intellect. Tact is the part of judgment, mathematics of the
intellect.</p>

<p>To make light of philosophy is to be a true philosopher.</p>

<p>The nourishment of the body is little by little, too much
nourishment gives little substance.</p>

<br />

<p>There is an universal and essential difference between the
actions of the will and all others.</p>

<p>The will is one of the principal organs of belief, not that it
forms belief, but because things are true or false according to
the side from which we regard them. The will, pleased with
one rather than the other, turns the mind from the consideration
of that which has the qualities it cares not to see, and thus
the intellect, moving with the will, stays to regard the side it
loves, and thus judges by what it sees.</p>

<br />

<p>The heart has its reasons, which reason knows not, as we feel
in a thousand instances. I say that the heart loves the universal
Being naturally, and itself naturally, according as it gives
itself to each, and it hardens itself against one or the other at its
own will. You have rejected one and kept the other, does
reason cause your love?</p>

<p>It is the heart which is conscious of God, not the reason.
This then is faith; God sensible to the heart, not to the reason.</p>

<br />

<p>Reason acts slowly and with so many views, on so many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
principles, which it ought always to keep before it, that it constantly
slumbers and goes astray, from not having its principles
at hand. The heart does not act thus, it acts in a moment, and
is always ready to act. We must then place our faith in the
heart, or it will be always vacillating.</p>

<br />

<p>Men often mistake their imagination for their heart, and they
believe they are converted as soon as they think of being converted.</p>

<br />

<p>Those who are accustomed to judge by the heart do not understand
the process of reasoning, for they wish to understand at a
glance, and are not accustomed to seek for principles. And others
on the contrary, who are accustomed to reason by principles,
do not at all understand the things of the heart, seeking principles
and not being able to see at a glance.</p>

<br />

<p>If we wished to prove those examples by which we prove
other things, we should have to take those other things to be
examples. For as we always believe the difficulty is in the
matter we wish to prove, we find the examples clearer and aids
to demonstration.</p>

<p>Thus when we wish to demonstrate a general proposition, we
must give the rule special to a case, but if we wish to demonstrate
a particular case, we must begin with the particular rule. For
we always find the thing obscure which we wish to prove, and
that clear which we employ as proof; for when a matter is proposed
for proof we first fill ourselves with the imagination that
it is therefore obscure, and on the contrary that what is to prove
it is clear, and so we understand with ease.</p>

<br />

<p>Far from believing a thing because you have heard it,
you ought to believe nothing without having put yourself in the
same position as if you had never heard it.</p>

<p>What should make you believe is your own assent to yourself,
and the constant voice of your reason, not that of others.</p>

<p>Belief is so important!</p>

<p>A hundred contradictions might be true.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>If antiquity were the rule of faith then the men of old time had
no rule. If general consent, if men had perished....</p>

<p>False humility is pride.</p>

<p>Lift the curtain.</p>

<p>You may try as you please. You must either believe, or deny,
or doubt.</p>

<p>Have we then no rule?</p>

<p>We judge that animals do well what they do. Is there no
rule whereby to judge men?</p>

<p>To deny, to believe, and to doubt well are to a man what
paces are to a horse.</p>

<br />

<p>Memory is necessary for every operation of the reason.</p>

<br />

<p>Memory and joy are feelings, and even mathematical propositions
become so, for reason makes what is felt natural, and
natural feelings are effaced by reason.</p>

<br />

<p>All our reasoning is reduced to yielding to feeling.</p>

<p>But fancy is like yet contrary to feeling, so that we cannot
distinguish between these contraries. One man says that my
feeling is fancy, another that his fancy is feeling. We must
have a rule. Reason offers herself, but she is pliable in all
directions, and so there is no rule.</p>

<br />

<p>Reason commands us much more imperiously than a master,
for in disobeying the one we are unhappy, and in disobeying
the other we are fools.</p>

<br />

<p>When we are accustomed to use bad reasons for proving
natural effects, we do not wish to receive good reasons even
when they are discovered. An example may be taken from the
circulation of the blood, to give a reason why the vein swells
below the ligature.</p>

<br />

<p>We are usually better persuaded by reasons which we have
ourselves discovered, than by those which have come into the
mind of others.</p>

<br />

<p>M. de Roannez said: "Reasons come afterwards, but at first a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
thing pleases or shocks me, without my knowing the reason, and
yet it displeased me for the reason which I only discover later."
But I believe, not that he was displeased for those reasons which
he afterwards discovered, but that those reasons were only
discovered because the thing was displeasing.</p>

<br />

<p><em>The difference between the mathematical mind and the practical
mind.</em>&mdash;In the one the premisses are palpable, but removed
from ordinary use, so that from want of habit it is difficult to
look in that direction, but if we take the trouble to look, the
premisses are fully visible, and we must have a totally incorrect
mind if we draw wrong inferences from premisses so plain
that it is scarce possible they should escape our notice.</p>

<p>But in the practical mind the premisses are taken from use
and wont, and are before the eyes of every body. We have
only to look that way, there is no difficulty in seeing them; it
is only a question of good eyesight, but it must be good, for the
premisses are so numerous and so subtle, that it is scarce
possible but that some escape us. Now the omission of one
premiss leads to error, thus we must have very clear sight to
see all the premisses, and then an accurate mind not to draw
false conclusions from known premisses.</p>

<p>All mathematicians would then be practical if they were
clear-sighted, for they do not reason incorrectly on premisses
known to them. And practical men would be mathematicians
if they could turn their eyes to the premisses of mathematics
to which they are unaccustomed.</p>

<p>The reason therefore that some practical men are not mathematical
is that they cannot at all turn their attention to
mathematical premisses. But the reason that mathematicians
are not practical is that they do not see what is before them, and
that, accustomed to the precise and distinct statements of mathematics
and not reasoning till they have well examined and
arranged their premisses, they are lost in practical life wherein
the premisses do not admit of such arrangement, being scarcely
seen, indeed they are felt rather than seen, and there is great
difficulty in causing them to be felt by those who do not of themselves
perceive them. They are so nice and so numerous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
that a very delicate and very clear sense is needed to apprehend
them, and to judge rightly and justly when they are apprehended,
without as a rule being able to demonstrate them in an orderly
way as in mathematics; because the premisses are not before
us in the same way, and because it would be an infinite matter
to undertake. We must see them at once, at one glance, and
not by process of reasoning, at least up to a certain degree. And
thus it is rare that mathematicians are practical, or that practical
men are mathematicians, because mathematicians wish to
treat practical life mathematically; and they make themselves
ridiculous, wishing to begin by definitions and premisses, a proceeding
which this way of reasoning will not bear. The mind does
indeed the same thing, but tacitly, naturally and without art, in
a way which none can express, and only a few can feel.</p>

<p>Practical minds on the contrary, being thus accustomed to
judge at a glance, are amazed when propositions are presented
to them of which they understand nothing and the way to which
is through sterile definitions and premisses, which they are not
accustomed to see thus in detail, and therefore are repelled and
disheartened.</p>

<p>But inaccurate minds are never either practical or mathematical.
Mathematicians who are only mathematicians have exact
minds, provided all things are clearly set before them in definitions
and premisses, otherwise they are inaccurate and intolerable,
for they are only accurate when the premisses are perfectly
clear.</p>

<p>And practical men, who are only practical, cannot have the
patience to condescend to first principles of things speculative
and abstract, which they have never seen in the world, and to
which they are wholly unaccustomed.</p>

<br />

<p>There are various kinds of good sense, there are some who
judge correctly in a certain order of things, and are lost in others.</p>

<p>Some are able to draw conclusions well from a few premisses,
and this shows a penetrative intellect.</p>

<p>Others draw conclusions well where there are many premisses.</p>

<p>For instance, the first easily understand the laws of hydrostatics,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
where the premisses are few, but the conclusions so nice,
that only the greatest penetration can reach them. And these
persons would perhaps not necessarily be great mathematicians,
because mathematics embrace a great number of premisses, and
perhaps a mind may be so formed that it searches with ease a
few premisses to the bottom, yet cannot at all comprehend those
matters in which there are many premisses.</p>

<p>There are then two kinds of mind, the one able to penetrate
vigorously and deeply into the conclusions of certain premisses,
and these are minds true and just. The other able to
comprehend a great number of premisses without confusion,
and these are the minds for mathematics. The one kind has
force and exactness, the other capacity. Now the one quality
can exist without the other, a mind may be vigorous and narrow,
or it may have great range and no strength.</p>

<br />

<p>When we do not know the truth of a thing, it is not amiss that
there should be a common error to fix the mind of men, as for
instance the moon, to which is attributed the change of seasons,
the progress of diseases, etc. For the principal malady
of man is that restless curiosity about matters which he can not
understand, and it is not so bad for him to be mistaken, as to be
so idly curious.</p>

<p>The way in which Epictetus, Montaigne, and Salomon de
Tultie wrote, is the most usual, the most insinuating, the most
easily remembered, and the most often quoted; because it is
wholly composed of thoughts which arise out of the ordinary
conversations of life. As when a man speaks of the vulgar
error that the moon is the cause of all, we never fail to say
that Salomon de Tultie says, that when we know not the truth
of a matter, it is well there should be a common error, etc;
which is the thought above.</p>

<br />

<p>To write against those who plunged too deep into science.
Descartes.</p>

<br />

<p>Descartes.</p>

<p>We must say in general: "This is made by figure and motion
for it is true." But to say what these are, and to compose the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
machine, is ridiculous, for it is useless, uncertain, and painful.
And if it were true we do not think that all philosophy is worth
one hour of pain.</p>

<br />

<p>I cannot forgive Descartes.</p>

<br />

<p>If an animal did by mind what it does by instinct, and if it
spoke by mind what it speaks by instinct, in hunting, and warning
its companions that the quarry is found or lost, it would
certainly also speak in regard to those things which affect it
more strongly, as for instance, "Gnaw me this cord which
hurts me, and which I cannot reach."</p>

<br />

<p>The story of the pike and frog of Liancourt. They do it
always and never otherwise, nor any other thing of mind.</p>

<br />

<p>The calculating machine works results which approach nearer
to thought than any thing done by animals, but it does nothing
which enables us to say it has any will, as animals have.</p>

<br />

<p>When it is said that heat is only the motion of certain
molecules, and light the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">conatus recedendi</i> which we feel, we are
surprised. And shall we think that pleasure is but the buoyancy
of our spirits? We have conceived so different an idea of it, and
these sensations seem so removed from those others which we
say are the same as those with which we compare them. The
feeling of fire, the warmth which affects us in a manner wholly
different from touch, the reception of sound and light, all this
seems to us mysterious, and yet it is as material as the blow of
a stone. It is true that the minuteness of the spirits which enter
into the pores touch different nerves, yet nerves are always
touched.</p>

<br />

<p>What is more absurd than to say that inanimate bodies have
passion, fear, horror, that insensible bodies, without life, and
even incapable of life, have passions, which presuppose at least
a sensitive soul to feel them, nay more, that the object of their
terror is a vacuum? What is there in a vacuum which should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
make them afraid? What can be more base and more ridiculous?
Nor is this all; it is said they have in themselves a principle of
motion to avoid a vacuum. Have they arms, legs, muscles,
nerves?</p>

<br />

<p>How foolish is painting, which draws admiration by the resemblance
of things of which we do not admire the originals.</p>

<br />

<p>In the same way that we injure the understanding we injure
the feelings also.</p>

<p>The feelings and the understanding are formed by society,
and are perverted by society. Thus good or bad society forms
or perverts them. It is then of the first importance to know
how to choose in order to form and not to pervert them, and we
cannot make this choice if they be not already formed and not
perverted. Thus a circle is formed, and happy are those who
escape it.</p>

<br />

<p>Have you never seen persons, who, in order to complain of the
little you make of them, bring before you the example of people in
high position who esteem them? To such I answer, "Show me
the merit by which you have charmed these persons, and I will
esteem you too."</p>

<br />

<p>The world is full of good maxims. All that is needed is their
right application. For instance, no one doubts that we ought to
risk our lives for the common weal, and many do so. But for
Religion, none.</p>

<br />

<p>Nature diversifies and imitates, art imitates and diversifies.</p>

<br />

<p>The more intellect we have ourselves, the more originality do we
discover in others. Ordinary people find no difference between
men.</p>

<br />

<p>Since we cannot be universal, and know all that is to be
known of everything, we should know a little of everything.
For it is far better to know something of all than to know the
whole of one thing, this universality is the best. If we can have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
both, still better, but if we must choose, let us choose the first.
The world feels and acts on this, and the world is often a good
judge.</p>

<br />

<p>Certain authors speaking of their works, say: "My book, my
commentary, my history, etc." They are like the middle-class
people who have a small house of their own, and have "my
house" always on the tongue. They would do better to say:
"Our book, our commentary, our history, etc."; because there
is in them generally more of other people's than their own.</p>

<br />

<p>A true friend is so great an advantage, even for the greatest
lords, in order that he may speak well of them, and uphold them
in their absence, that they ought to do all that is possible to have
one. But they should choose well, for spite of all they may do
for fools, whatever good these say of them would be useless,
and they would not even speak well of them if they found themselves
in the minority, for they are without authority. And thus
they would abuse them in company.</p>

<br />

<p>"You are ungraceful, excuse me, I beg." Without that excuse I
had not known there was aught amiss. "With reverence be it
spoke...." The only evil is the excuse.</p>

<br />

<p>I always dislike such compliments as these: <em>I have given you
a great deal of trouble.</em> <em>I fear I am tiring you.</em> <em>I fear this is
too long.</em> For we either have our audience with us, or we provoke
them.</p>

<br />

<p>Rivers are roads which move and carry us whither we wish
to go.</p>

<br />

<p>In every action we must look beyond the action at our past,
present and future state, and at others whom it affects, and see
the relations of all these things. And then we shall be very
careful.</p>

<br />

<p>In every dialogue and discourse we ought to be able to say to
those who are offended, "Of what do you complain?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<br />

<p>There are many people who listen to the sermon as they listen
to vespers.</p>

<p>When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are
in peace.</p>

<p>P. 2. <em>Pascal's Profession of Faith.</em> A few days after Pascal's death,
a servant discovered this profession sewed into a fold of his master's
waistcoat, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pourpoint</i>. It was written on parchment, with a copy on
paper. His family believed that he had carefully placed this in each
new garment, desiring to have always about him the memorial of the
great spiritual crisis.</p>

<p>P. 3, l. 32. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dereliquerunt me.</i> Jer. li. 13.</p>

<p>P. 3. <em>General Introduction.</em> In this are apparently two drafts of the
same preface, the second beginning with the paragraph "Before entering,"
p. 9, l. 6. M. Faugère was the first to recognize the true character of
this sketch, which has borne various titles. The Port Royal edition
called it: "Against the Indifference of Atheists;" Condorcet headed it:
"On the Need of Concern for the Proofs of a Future Life;" Bossut:
"On the Need of a Study of Religion." See <a href="#N61">note on p. 61</a>.</p>

<p>P. 3, l. 8. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Deus absconditus.</i> Is. xlv. 15. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vere tu es Deus absconditus,
Deus Israel salvator.</i></p>

<p>P. 11. <em>Notes for the General Introduction.</em> The fragments following
are thus arranged by Molinier as having been in his judgment intended
for and many of them expanded in the preceding Preface.</p>

<a name="N12" id="N12"></a>
<p>P. 12, l. 23. <em>Miton</em> was a man of fashion at Paris, a friend of
Pascal's friend, the Chevalier de Méré.</p>

<p>P. 17. <em>Preface to the First Part.</em> This is Pascal's own title to the
section.</p>

<p>P. 17, l. 2. <em>Charron</em>, Pierre, was born at Paris in 1541. He was
a friend of Montaigne, whose philosophy he adopted. His <cite>Traité de la
Sagesse</cite>, Bordeaux, 1601, is the work of whose elaborate divisions Pascal
complains.</p>

<p>P. 17, l. 12. <em>Montaigne's defects.</em> Mademoiselle de Gournay,
Montaigne's adopted daughter, defends the Essayist in regard to this
matter, in the preface to her edition of the Essays, Paris, 1595.</p>

<p>P. 17, l. 14. <em>people without eyes.</em> Montaigne, <cite>Essais</cite>, l. ii. ch. xii.</p>

<p>P. 17, l. 15. <em>squaring the circle</em>. <em>Ib.</em>, l. ii. ch. xiv.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>P. 17, l. 15. <em>a greater world.</em> Montaigne, <cite>Essais</cite>, l. ii. ch. xii.</p>

<p>P. 17, l. 16. <em>on suicide and on death.</em> <em>Ib.</em>, l. i. ch. iii.</p>

<p>P. 17, l. 17. <em>without fear and without repentance.</em> <em>Ib.</em>, l. iii. ch. ii.</p>

<p>P. 19. <em>Man's Disproportion.</em> Pascal's own title.</p>

<p>P. 19, l. 34. <em>the centre of which is every where, the circumference no
where.</em> Voltaire attributed this famous saying to the pseudo-Timæus of
Locris, an abridgement of Plato's <cite>Timæus</cite>, but in neither work is the
whole sentence to be found. The saying, however, is not originally
Pascal's. It is probably borrowed from Mlle. de Gournay's preface
to her edition of Montaigne, Paris, 1635, and was taken by her from
Rabelais, bk. iii. ch. 13, where it is attributed to Hermes Trismegistus.
M. Havet, who gives these, and many more details, finally
traces it, on the authority of Vincent de Beauvais, 1200-1264, to Empedocles.</p>

<p>P. 21, l. 36. <em>I will discourse of the all.</em> This saying of Democritus
is taken by Pascal from Montaigne, <cite>Essais</cite>, l. ii. ch. xii.</p>

<p>P. 22, l. 4. <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De omni scibili.</cite> The title given to nine hundred propositions,
put forth at Rome by Pico della Mirandola, then aged twenty-three,
in 1486.</p>

<p>P. 22, l. 8. <em>The Principles of Philosophy.</em> Descartes wrote a work
with this title, <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Principia Philosophiæ</cite>.</p>

<p>P. 22, l. 38. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Beneficia eo usque lata sunt.</i> Tacitus, <em>Ann.</em> lib. iv.
c. xviii. Taken by Pascal from Montaigne, <cite>Essais</cite>, l. iii. ch. viii.</p>

<p>P. 24, l. 27. <em>And what completes our inability.</em> Compare for the
whole of the passage on matter and spirit, Descartes, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Discours de la
Méthode</cite>.</p>

<p>P. 25, l. 34. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Modus quo corporibus adhæret spiritus.</i> S. Aug. <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De
Civitate Dei</cite>, xxi. 10. Taken by Pascal from Montaigne, <cite>Essais</cite>, l. ii.
ch. xii.</p>

<p>P. 26, l. 31. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lustravit lampade terras.</i> The full couplet is</p>

<div lang="la" xml:lang="la" class="poetry-container ital"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">Tales sunt hominum mentes, quali pater ipse</p>
<p class="verse">Jupiter auctiferas lustravit lampade terras.</p>
</div></div>

<p>S. Aug. <cite>De Civitate Dei</cite>, v. 8, a translation by Cicero of two lines in the
<cite>Odyssey</cite>, xviii. 136. The quotation is borrowed from Montaigne,
<cite>Essais</cite>, l. ii. ch. xii.</p>

<p>P. 27, l. 20. <em>a fly is buzzing.</em> Borrowed from Montaigne, <cite>Essais</cite>,
l. iii. ch. xiii.</p>

<p>P. 27, l. 26. <em>flies which win battles.</em> Montaigne relates that the
Portuguese besieging the town of Tamly were obliged to raise the
siege on account of the clouds of flies. <cite>Essais</cite>, l. ii. ch. xii.</p>

<p>P. 28, l. 12. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Memoria hospitis unius diei prætereuntis.</i> Lib. Sap.
v. 14.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>P. 30, l. 4. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Plerumque gratæ</i>, altered from Hor. <em>Carm.</em> iii. 29, v. 13.
<em>plerumque gratæ</em> divitibus <em>vices</em>.</p>

<p>P. 30, l. 13. <em>Epaminondas.</em> The example is taken from Montaigne,
<cite>Essais</cite>, l. ii. ch. xxxvi.</p>

<p>P. 31, l. 22. <em>Sneezing absorbs all the faculties.</em> A paraphrase of a
passage in Montaigne, <cite>Essais</cite>, l. iii. ch. v.</p>

<p>P. 31, l. 28. <em>Scaramouch</em>. One of the traditional parts in Italian
Comedy, at that time played by the well-known actor Tiberio Fiorelli,
whom Pascal had probably seen.</p>

<p>P. 31, l. 29. <em>The doctor</em>, also a common character in Italian forces.
Molière has borrowed from the Italian stage his doctor, so often a
pedant and a fool, of whom le docteur Pancrace, in <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Marriage Forcé</cite>,
is perhaps the most notable example, though that comedy was produced
after the death of Pascal.</p>

<p>P. 32, l. 11. <em>the Condrieu, the Desargues.</em> Gerard Desargues was
a mathematician at Condrieu on the Rhone, who had been Pascal's
teacher. Among the Muscat grapes grown at Condrieu, Pascal distinguishes
a special variety of Desargues, and among these a particular
vine.</p>

<p>P. 32, l. 28. <em>the Passion of Cleobuline.</em> In <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Artamène, on le Grand
Cyrus</cite>, the celebrated romance of Mademoiselle de Scudery, Cleobuline,
princess, afterwards queen of Corinth, is one of the principal characters.
She is represented as in love with Myrinthe, one of her subjects, but
"she loved him without thinking of love; and remained so long in her
error, that when she became aware of it, her affection was no longer in
a condition to be overcome."</p>

<p>P. 33. <em>Diversion.</em> Under this heading Pascal comprises not only
trivial occupations, and the distractions of idle society, but all which,
save truth alone, can form the study or the research of man. The main
idea of the chapter is borrowed from Montaigne, <cite>Essais</cite>, l. iii. chap. x.</p>

<p>P. 35. l. 17. <em>The counsel given to Pyrrhus.</em> <em>Ib.</em>, l. i. ch. xliii.</p>

<p>P. 36, l. 11. <em>as children are frightened at a face.</em> Borrowed from
Montaigne, <cite>Essais</cite>, l. ii. ch. iii., and Montaigne in his turn borrowed it
from Seneca, <cite>Ep.</cite> 24.</p>

<p>P. 36, l. 28. <em>superintendent.</em> Of finances. The last who held this
office was Fouquet, still in office when this was written. He was dismissed
in disgrace in 1661.</p>

<p>P. 36, l. 29. <em>first president.</em> Of the Parliament of Paris.</p>

<p>P. 36, l. 32. <em>dismissed to their country houses.</em> At that date, and
for a long time afterwards, a Minister of State rarely fell from Office
without receiving a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lettre de cachet</i> which banished him to the seclusion
of his country estate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>P. 39, l. 17. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">In omnibus requiem quæsivi.</i> Eccles. xxiv. 7.</p>

<p>P. 40, l. 9. <em>will arise weariness.</em> Compare Montaigne, <cite>Essais</cite>, l. iii.</p>

<p>P. 41, l. 7. <em>Cæsar was too old.</em> See Montaigne, <cite>Essais</cite>, l. ii. ch.
xxxiv.</p>

<p>P. 43. <em>The Greatness and Littleness of Man.</em> The title suggested
by Pascal, in many passages of the autograph MS.</p>

<p>P. 43, l. 11. <em>for Port Royal.</em> The letters A. P. R. occur in several
places in Pascal's MS. It is generally thought that they mean <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à Port-Royal</i>,
and are intended to indicate subjects to be developed later in
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">conférences</i> or lectures at that house.</p>

<p>P. 45, l. 1. <em>Man is neither angel nor brute.</em> This is closely borrowed
from Montaigne, <cite>Essais</cite>, l. iii. ch. xiii.</p>

<p>P. 46, l. 15. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Corrumpunt mores bonos colloquia prava.</i> 1 ad Cor.
xv. 33, but the Vulgate reading has <em>mala</em>.</p>

<p>P. 47, l. 18. <em>Paulus Emilius.</em> The example is taken from Montaigne,
<cite>Essais</cite>, l. i. ch. xix. See also Cic. <cite>Tuscul.</cite> v. 40.</p>

<p>P. 47, l. 31. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ego vir videns</i>, Lament, iii. 1. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ego vir videns paupertatem
meam in virga indignationis ejus.</i></p>

<p>P. 51. <em>Of the deceptive powers</em>, etc. This is Pascal's own title for
this section.</p>

<p>P. 51, l. 14. <em>Imagination.</em> Pascal uses this word in an extended
sense already given to it by Montaigne, and means that faculty by
which we attribute a value to those things which in fact have none.</p>

<p>P. 53, l. 11. <em>furred cats.</em> Rabelais, bk. v. ch. 11.</p>

<p>P. 54, l. 2. <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Della Opinione.</i> No work is known under this name.
Pascal possibly means a work of Carlo Flosi, <cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">L'Opinione tiranna,
moralmente considerata ne gli affari del mondo</cite>, Mondovi, 1690. But it
is not certain that this edition is the reprint of a work extant before
Pascal wrote.</p>

<p>P. 54, l. 27. <em>Diseases are another source of error.</em> Taken from
Montaigne, <cite>Essais</cite>, l. ii. ch. xii.</p>

<a name="N56" id="N56"></a>
<p>P. 56, l. 20. <em>in Switzerland that of the burgesses.</em> This may be compared
with p. 66, l. 6. In the majority of Swiss towns every candidate for
municipal office must needs possess the freedom of the town, but the
intention was not to set aside those of noble birth, as Pascal supposes,
but foreigners, and those of other towns, each of which was considered
as a separate state.</p>

<p>P. 57, l. 27. <em>would care nothing for Provence.</em> Compare Montaigne,
<cite>Essais</cite>, l. i. ch. xxii. "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C'est par l'entremise de la coustume que chascun
est contant du lieu où nature l'a planté: et les sauvages d'Escosse n'ont
que faire de la Touraine, ny les Scythes de la Thessalie.</i>"</p>

<p>P. 57, l. 28. <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ferox gens.</cite> Livy, l. xxxiv. c. 17.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>P. 58. l. 20. <em>Brave deeds.</em> Borrowed from Montaigne, <cite>Essais</cite>, l. i.
ch. xl.</p>

<a name="N61" id="N61"></a>
<p>P. 61. <em>Of Justice</em>, etc. These fragments, now among the best
known of Pascal's Thoughts, but for the most part brought to notice in
the Edition of Bossut, 1779, have their present arrangement and title
from Molinier.</p>

<p>P. 61, l. 30. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nihil amplius.</i> These sentences, borrowed from
Montaigne, are quoted, the first of them wrongly, from Cicero, <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De
Finibus</cite>, v. 21; the second from Seneca, <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ad Lucilium</cite>, <em>Ep.</em> 95; the
third from Tacitus, <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Annales</cite>, iii. 25. Compare with the whole passage
Montaigne, <cite>Essais</cite>, l. ii. ch. xii. and l. iii. ch. xiii.</p>

<p>P. 62, l. 29. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quum veritatem.</i> S. Aug., <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Civit. Dei</cite>, iv. 31.
From Montaigne, <cite>Essais</cite>, l. ii. ch. iii.</p>

<p>P. 62, l. 27. <em>the wisest of law givers.</em> Socrates, in the <cite>Republic</cite> of
Plato.</p>

<p>P. 63, l. 9. <em>Archesilas.</em> Born at Pitane in Æolis of a Scythian
father, about 300 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> He was founder of the School known as the
Second Academy. See Montaigne, <cite>Essais</cite>, l. ii. ch. iii.</p>

<p>P. 64, l. 19. For all that is here said on Custom, see Montaigne,
<cite>Essais</cite>, l. i. ch. xxii.</p>

<p>P. 65, l. 7. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pasce oves meas.</i> Joh. xxi. 17. The words are those
taken as the foundation of papal authority. You owe me pasturage, <em>i.e.</em>
you owe me justice.</p>

<p>P. 65, l. 30. <em>the soldiers of Mahomet, thieves, heretics.</em> Pascal
boldly joins heretics and thieves, for those who did not hold his
creed appeared to him as men <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans foi ni loi</i>, faithless and lawless.
In his eyes a Turk was scarce a man. See the <cite>Provincial Letters</cite>,
let. xiv. "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sont-ce des religieux et des prêtres qui parlent de cette sorte?
Sont-ce des Chrétiens? Sont-ce des Tures? Sont-ce des demons?</i>"
And <cite>Thoughts</cite>, p. 211, l. 30. "Do we not see beasts live and die like
men, and Turks like Christians."</p>

<p>P. 66, l. 6. <em>The Swiss.</em> See <a href="#N56">note on p. 56</a>, l. 20.</p>

<p>P. 66, l. 10. <em>condemning so many Spaniards to death.</em> Possibly
an allusion to the battle of the Dunes, 1659, which led to the Peace
of the Pyrenees, so long desired by all but Spain, then obliged to consent.</p>

<p>P. 67, l. 13. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Summum jus, summa injuria.</i> Charron, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Traité de la
Sagesse</cite>, etc. ch. xxvii. art. 8.</p>

<p>P. 67, l. 26. <em>The end of the Twelfth Provincial.</em> The following is the
passage to which Pascal alludes. "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C'est une etrange et longue guerre
que celle où la violence essaye d'opprimer la vérité. Tons les efforts de la
violence ne peuvent affaiblir la vérité, et ne servent qu'à la relever
davantage. Toutes les lumières de la vérité ne peuvent rien pour arrêter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
la violence et ne font que l'irriter encore plus ... la violence et la
vérité ne peuvent rien l'une sur l'autre.</i>"</p>

<p>P. 67, l. 27. <em>The Fronde.</em> This was the name given to the party
which rose against Mazarin and the Court during the minority of
Louis XIV., and plunged France into civil war.</p>

<p>P. 69, l. 10. <em>give me the strap.</em> This is no exaggeration, since
fifty years after Pascal wrote, Voltaire was beaten by the servants of the
Duc de Rohan.</p>

<p>P. 69, l. 12. <em>It is odd that Montaigne.</em> <cite>Essais</cite>, l. i. ch. xlii.</p>

<p>P. 69, l. 16. <em>When power attacks craft.</em> <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Satyre Menippée</cite>, Harangue
du Sire de Rieux: "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">il n'y a ny bonnet quarré, ny bourlet, que je ne face
voler</i>."</p>

<p>P. 69, l. 30. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">figmentum malum.</i> Ps. ciii. 13. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quomodo miseretur
pater filiorum, misertus est Dominus timentibus se: Quoniam ipse
cognovit figmentum nostrum.</i></p>

<p>P. 70, l. 14. <em>Savages laugh at an infant king.</em> Pascal is alluding to
the story in Montaigne, <cite>Essais</cite>, l. i. ch. xxx., of the savages presented
to Charles IX. at Rouen, who were astonished to see bearded men
obey a child.</p>

<p>P. 72, l. 16. <em>Epictetus.</em> See <a href="#Page_45">p. 45</a>, l. 30, in order to understand
this somewhat enigmatic fragment. In the next paragraph is an
allusion to the passage in which Epictetus says, l. iv. ch. 7, that the
philosopher may well be constant and detached from life by wisdom, as
were the Galilæans by their fanaticism.</p>

<p>P. 73. <em>Weakness, unrest, and defects of man.</em> The arrangements
of these fragments under this title is Molinier's.</p>

<p>P. 73, l. 1. <em>We anticipate the future.</em> Compare Montaigne, <cite>Essais</cite>,
l. i. ch. iii.</p>

<p>P. 74, l. 28. <em>Alexander's chastity.</em> To attribute this virtue to
Alexander is strange, but no doubt the circumstance in Pascal's thought
was his generous conduct to the family of Darius, after the battle of Issus.</p>

<p>P. 75, l. 12. <em>the King of England.</em> Probably Charles II., then
living in exile, rather than Charles I. The King of Poland was Jean
Casimir, driven from his throne by Charles X. of Sweden, after the
battle of Warsaw in 1656. The Queen of Sweden was Christina,
daughter of Gustavus Adolphus, who abdicated in favour of her cousin,
Charles X., in 1654.</p>

<p>P. 75, l. 29. <em>we shall die alone</em>, "on mourra seul." It is a curious
instance of the fact how little Pascal is known in England, that Keble
having quoted this sentence wrongly, probably from memory, in the
first edition of the <cite>Christian Year</cite>, as "Je mourrai seul," it has
remained uncorrected and apparently unnoticed to this day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p>P. 76, l. 12. <em>Cromwell.</em> As Charles II. was restored in 1660,
this fragment was written about that date, two years before Pascal's
death. Cromwell's death did not arise from the cause stated in the text.</p>

<p>P. 77, l. 8. <em>the automaton.</em> The expression of Descartes and his
school for the animal body.</p>

<p>P. 77, l. 25. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Inclina cor meum, Deus.</i> Ps. cxix. 36. "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Inclina
cor meum in testimonia tua, et non in avaritiam.</i>"</p>

<p>P. 77, l. 30. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eritis sicut dii.</i> Gen. iii. 5.</p>

<p>P. 79, l. 30. <em>men laugh and weep at the same thing.</em> The thought
is from Charron, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Traité de la Sagesse</cite>, l. i. ch. xxxviii.</p>

<p>P. 80, l. 35. <em>the grand Sultan.</em> None of Pascal's editors have
discovered whence he drew this purely fictitious description of the
Sultan.</p>

<p>P. 81, l. 9. <em>That epigram about the two one-eyed people.</em> This is not
Martial's. It is found in <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Epigrammatum Delectus</cite>, published by Port
Royal in 1659.</p>

<p>P. 83, l. 22. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Spongia solis.</i> The spots on the sun. Du Cange
explains <em>spongia</em> by <em>macula</em>. Pascal seems to mean that the spots on
the sun prepare us for its total extinction; that the sun will eventually
expire, so that, contrary as it seems to the course of nature, there will
come a day when there will be no sun.</p>

<p>P. 89. The title given to this second part is furnished by Pascal.
In the first part he has wished to prove the fallen state of man, and his
weakness; he now maintains that man may be restored by faith in
Jesus Christ, and the practice of religion.</p>

<p>P. 113, l. 15. <em>two sects.</em> Epicureans and Stoics.</p>

<p>P. 113, l. 17. <em>Des Barreaux.</em> Jacques Desbarreaux was an Epicurean
poet born at Paris in 1602, died in 1673, who in his poems
paraded his unbelief. Curiously enough, his only extant verses were
written when he lay ill, and are addressed to God.</p>

always speaks as though they taught one and the same philosophy.</p>

<p>P. 114, l. 3. <em>two inches under water</em>, are equally drowned with

<p>P. 115. The fragments collected in this chapter are here placed
by Molinier according to the plan which Pascal had traced out for his
work, in which after he had laid the various philosophical systems
before his supposed unbeliever, he brought forward for examination the
other religions.</p>

<p>P. 115, l. 20. <em>forbade men to read it.</em> It is not known whence Pascal
obtained this statement, which is a complete mistake.</p>

<p>P. 116, l. 15. <em>Jesus Christ wills that his testimony to himself should

does not name Saint Matthew, but says in general terms that Mahomet
regarded the apostles of Jesus as holy.</p>

<p>P. 117, l. 27. <em>whose witnesses let themselves be slaughtered.</em> After
this Pascal had written, but erased the words "which of the two is most
to be blamed, Moses or China?" and these aid us in the explanation of
this enigmatic passage. The Jesuits had established themselves in
China at the end of the sixteenth century, and when Pascal wrote their
missions were in a flourishing state. They had studied the language,
history, and literature of China. But the difficulty presented itself of
reconciling the cosmogony and chronology of the Bible with those of the
Chinese sages. It is probable that this passage was inspired by a
private conversation with some one who had read letters from a missionary,
for no book on the subject appears to have existed in Pascal's
day.</p>

<p>P. 126, l. 17. <em>If the story in Esdras is credible.</em> In the 14th Chapter
of the Second Book of Esdras God appears to Esdras in a bush, and
orders him to assemble the people and deliver the message. Esdras
replies, "I will go as thou hast commanded me, and reprove the people
which are present, but they that shall be born afterward who shall
admonish them?... <em>For thy law is burnt</em>, therefore no man knoweth the
things that are done of thee, or the works that shall begin. But if I have
found grace before thee, send the Holy Ghost into me, and I shall write
all that hath been done in the world since the beginning." ... Then
God ordered him to take five scribes, to whom for forty days he dictated
the ancient law.</p>

<p>The authenticity of this story, coming into conflict as it does with many
passages of the prophets, and specially with Jeremiah, appeared open to
such grave doubts, that at the Council of Trent the last book of Esdras,
called in the Catholic Church, Esdras IV., by Protestants Esdras II., was
then rejected from the Canon.</p>

his speculations on the fulfilment of Prophecy, and on the meaning of
the Hebrew letters, etc. The book, of which the full title is <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pugio
Fidei adversus Mauros et Judæos</cite>, was written in 1278 by Raymond
Martin, a Catalonian monk. It remained almost unknown for four
hundred years, and was first printed in 1651. It was, therefore, as it
were, a new book when Pascal became acquainted with it. Under the

philosophy.</p>

<p>P. 165, l. 34. <em>We have no right.</em> The following is the explanation
of this and the next two paragraphs: In Is. ix. 6, a prophecy
which the Rabbis apply to Messiah, and Christian interpreters to Jesus,
are the words: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Parvulus enim natus est nobis ... multiplicabatur
ejus imperium.</i> In the Hebrew words representing this latter clause,
the <em>closed mem</em>, a letter ordinarily employed only at the end of a
word, occurs where an <em>open mem</em> should be used. From this orthographic
mistake the Rabbis have concluded that Messiah would be
born of a virgin, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex virgine clausa</i>. Moreover, as the <em>closed mem</em> in
Hebrew writing means six hundred, the Rabbis supposed that Messiah
was to come six hundred years after Isaiah. The <em>final tsadé</em> has the
same value as the <em>closed mem</em>.</p>

<p>P. 166, l. 8. <em>the way of the philosopher's stone</em>, no doubt the way of
<em>finding</em> the philosopher's stone. The dreams of the alchemists on this
subject were early mingled with those of the Rabbis on the Messiah.
Nor had the Cabbala lost all credit in Pascal's days. In 1629 Robert
Fludd, in Latin De Fluctibus, an Englishman, educated at Oxford, and
a Fellow of the College of Physicians, published at Frankfort his
<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Medicina Catholica</cite>. In this, sect 1. pt. ii. b. 1. ch. i. he speaks
of sicknesses and healing as both sent from God by angelic intermediaries,
and that all angelic natures are summed up in the great angel
Mittatron, whom the Scriptures call Wisdom. In a further passage he
says that in him whom the Cabalists call Mittatron others recognise
Messiah, and quotes the passage of Isaiah in which occurs the <em>closed
mem</em>.</p>

<p>In Reuchlin's book <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Arte Cabalistica</cite> the <em>open mem</em> is said to represent
the sphere of Jupiter, and the <em>closed mem</em> the sphere of Mars.</p>

<p>P. 166, l. 12. <em>Apocalyptics.</em> Interpreters of the Apocalypse.</p>

<p>P. 166, l. 13. <em>Preadamites.</em> Those who hold that Adam was the

on earth for a thousand years.</p>

to write <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les six orients</i>, dawns or mornings, his amanuensis has written
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les six arians</i>, a source of much misunderstanding. The six mornings
are, the creation; the deliverance from the Ark; the call of Abraham;
the carrying away into Babylon; the preaching of Jesus.</p>

Pascal's niece, aged ten, was cured of lachrymal fistula on March 24,
1656, after touching the diseased part with a reliquary containing a
thorn from the Saviour's crown. This was at the time that Port Royal
was suffering deeply from persecution, and was considered by many a
signal mark of the favour of heaven. The Jesuits did not deny the
miracle, but the conclusions drawn from it.</p>

<p>P. 268, l. 22. <em>do not believe that the five propositions are in Jansenius.</em>
To explain this fully would need a far longer note than can here be
given. It may be said shortly that the allusion is to the "Augustinus"
of Cornelius Jansen, Bishop of Ypres. Two questions arose: first,
whether the propositions condemned were heretical, and second,
whether if heretical they were in Jansen's book. The second assertion
was that which the nuns of Port Royal refused to make. They had not
read the book, and could not affirm that of which they were ignorant.
The five propositions were on the Doctrines of Grace and Free Will.</p>

<p>P. 269, l. 35. <em>Vatable</em>, who died in 1517, was professor of Hebrew at
the Collége Royal established by Francis I. In 1539 Robert Etienne
published an edition of the Latin Bible of Leo of Modena&mdash;Rabbi
Jehuda&mdash;to which he added under Vatable's name, notes which were
not really Vatable's, but borrowed from various writers of the Reformation.
These notes were condemned by the Sorbonne. The Bible
known as that of Vatable contains the Hebrew, the Vulgate Version,
and that of Rabbi Jehuda.</p>

<p>P. 271, l. 23. <em>miracles of Vespasian.</em> Tacitus, <cite>Hist.</cite> iv. 81.</p>

<p>P. 273. <em>Jesuits and Jansenists.</em> A collection of fragments on these
subjects, which perhaps might be considered rather as an appendix to,
or notes for the <cite>Provincial Letters</cite>, than a part of the <cite>Thoughts</cite>, properly
so called. But they form part of the autograph MS.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p>P. 275, l. 9. <em>Elias was a man like ourselves.</em> Quoted by memory
as from Saint Peter, but really from Saint James, v. 17.</p>

<p>P. 275, l. 14. <em>accused of many crimes.</em> Athanasius was accused of
rape, of murder, and of sacrilege. He was condemned by the Councils
of Tyre, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 335, of Arles, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 353, and of Milan <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 355. Pope
Liberius, after having long refused to ratify the condemnation, was
said to have finally done so <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 357. But this is disputed by recent
authorities. For Athanasius we are of course here to read Jansenius and
Arnauld; for Saint Theresa, la mère Angélique or la mère Agnès; for
Liberius, Clement IX.</p>

<p>P. 275, l. 33. <em>Antonio Escobar y Mendoza.</em> The Spanish Jesuit whose
system of morals was so severely handled by Pascal in the <cite>Provincial
Letters</cite>. He is among those whose names have given rise to a word:
"<em>escobarderie</em>" is a synonym for equivocation.</p>

<p>P. 276, l. 6. <em>Molina</em>, Louis, a Spanish Jesuit, born 1535, died 1601.
The Jansenists accused his Commentary on the Summa of Saint Thomas
Aquinas of favouring a lax morality.</p>

<p>P. 277, l. 4. <em>Mohatra.</em> "The contract Mohatra, by which a man
buys cloth at a dear rate and on credit, to re-sell it at once to the same
person cheaply for ready money." Eighth <cite>Provincial</cite>.</p>

<p>P. 279, l. 22. <em>M. de Condran.</em> No doubt Charles de Condren,
1588-1641, doctor of the Sorbonne, and second General of the French
Oratory, a society of priests founded by Cardinal de Bérulle at Paris
in 1611.</p>

<p>P. 280, l. 7. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sanctificavi prælium.</i> Mic. iii. 5.</p>

<p>P. 280, l. 12. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ne convertantur.</i> Is. vi. 10.</p>

the Vulgate has "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sibi</i>."</p>

<p>P. 282, l. 28. <em>not to make appointments to bishoprics.</em> But a few years
after this Fathers La Chaise and Le Tellier, as Confessors to the King,
had this power in their hands.</p>

<p>P. 282, l. 31. <em>Father Brisacier</em>, born 1603, a Jesuit, and a warm
opponent of Jansenism. He wrote <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Jansénisme confondu</cite>, and several
minor works. He is constantly quoted in the <cite>Provincial Letters</cite>.</p>

<p>P. 283, l. 1. <em>Venice.</em> The Jesuits had just returned to Venice in
1657, having been expelled thence in 1606.</p>

<p>P. 283, l. 22. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Amice, ad quid venisti.</i> Matt. xxvi. 50.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>

<p>P. 283, l. 24. <em>probability</em>, or, technically, probabilism. Probabilism
teaches that it is permissible to act on an opinion which is less probable
than the opinion opposed to it so long as there is a solid ground for
regarding it as probable <em>in itself</em>. Thus, if out of three moral theologians
of recognised authority, two give it as their opinion that a certain course
of conduct is unlawful, while the third asserts it to be lawful, probabilism
permits the adoption in practice of the third opinion in opposition to the
other two. A confessor would therefore have no right to forbid it under
pain of sin.</p>

<p>P. 284, l. 12. <em>Dii estis.</em> Ps. lxxxii. 6.</p>

<p>P. 284, l. 13. <em>If my Letters are condemned at Rome.</em> The <cite>Provincial
Letters</cite> were condemned at Rome, Sept. 6, 1657.</p>

<p>P. 285, l. 22. <em>imago.</em> An allusion to the famous panegyric on the
Jesuits called, "<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Imago primi sæculi</cite>." See Fifth <cite>Provincial</cite>.</p>

<p>P. 285, l. 36. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Si non fecissem quæ alius non fecit.</i> Jon. xv. 24.</p>

<p>P. 286, l. 31. <em>These nuns.</em> The nuns of Port Royal were called

<p>P. 288, l. 18. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vos autem non sic.</i> Luc. xxii. 26.</p>

<p>P. 289, l. 28. <em>Annat</em>, 1590-1670, a Jesuit priest, Provincial of the
Order, and Confessor to Louis XIV., 1654-1670. He wrote the well-known
book, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Rabat-joie des Jansénistes</cite>, 1666, and to him were
addressed Pascal's Seventeenth and Eighteenth <cite>Provincials</cite>.</p>

<p>P. 290, l. 9. <em>Montalte.</em> Louis de Montalte was the pseudonym
adopted by Pascal as the writer of the <cite>Provincial Letters</cite>.</p>

<p>P. 290, l. 26. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">A fructibus eorum.</i> Matt. vii. 16.</p>

<p>P. 291, l. 6. <em>Lessius</em>, Leonard, a Jesuit born at Brecht, near Antwerp,
1554, died 1623, a pupil of Suarez. He was censured by the Faculty
of Louvain in 1584. He wrote, among others, a treatise, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">De licito usu
æquivocationum et mentalium restrictionum</i>.</p>

<p>P. 291, l. 9. <em>Bauny.</em> Pascal in his Eighth <cite>Provincial</cite> quotes an opinion
of Father Bauny on the question of restitution to be made by one who
has caused the burning of his neighbour's barn.</p>

<p>P. 291, l. 10. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quam primum.</i> A reference to the rule that if a
priest personally disqualified from saying Mass on account of any mortal
sin is yet obliged to do so for the sake of his parishioners, it is sufficient
that he make an act of contrition, and as soon as possible "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quam primum</i>"
seek the Sacrament of Penance.</p>

<p>P. 292, l. 18. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">State super vias.</i> A partial quotation from Jer. vi. 16.</p>

<p>P. 293, l. 20. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vince in bono malum.</i> Ad Rom. xii. 21.</p>

<p>P. 298, l. 15. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nemo lucida obumbravit.</i> Matt. xvii. v.</p>

<p>P. 303, l. 6. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">plus poetice quam humane locutus es.</i> Petronius, c. 90,
where the words have not the turn that Pascal here gives them.</p>

<p>P. 304, l. 2. <em>The part that I take in your sorrow.</em> The Chevalier
de Méré, in his <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Discours de la Conversation</cite>, says, that he had been
witness to a bet, that on opening a letter of condolence the set phrase
condemned above would occur, and that the lady to whom the
letter was addressed could not help laughing in spite of her distress.
Pascal's note is against writing mere formal phrases which can thus be
easily guessed. The Cardinal is Mazarin.</p>

<p>P. 304, l. 9. <em>M. le M.</em> Le Maistre, Antoine, 1608-1658. The
allusion is to <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Plaidoyers et Harangues</cite> de M. le Maistre, Paris,
1657. On the first page of Plaidoyer VI., <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pour un fils mis en religion
par force</i>, we find "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dieu qui répand des aveuglements et des ténèbres
sur les passions illégitimes</i>," and Pascal probably refers to this passage as
one in which the word <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">répandre</i> could not be replaced by <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verser</i>.</p>

<p>P. 305, l. 23. <em>I judge by my watch.</em> Mlle. Perier says, that Pascal
always wore a watch attached to his left wrist-band.</p>

<p>P. 309, l. 27. <em>An example may be taken from the circulation of the
blood.</em> Apparently taken from Descartes, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><ins class="corr" title="Transcriber Note: Original text 'Discours sur la Méthode'">Discours de la Méthode</ins></cite>, pt.
v., in which Descartes speaks of Harvey's discovery.</p>

<p>P. 309, l. 33. <em>M. de Roannez.</em> Gouffier, Duc de Roannez, was a
friend of Pascal, some seven or eight years younger than he. He was
a devoted adherent of Port Royal, and died unmarried.</p>

<p>P. 312, l. 23. <em>Salomon de Tultie.</em> An anagram for Louis de Montalte,
see p. 290, l. 9.</p>

<p>P. 313, l. 11. <em>The story of the pike and frog.</em> This story has
hitherto escaped research.</p>
